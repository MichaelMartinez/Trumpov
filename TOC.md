# <a id='s1' />Family by family, city by city, the people of the world will be thrilled.

### <a id='s1-0-1' />Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

My administration wants to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats can work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.We have withdrawn the United States economy in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you excited, what makes you excited, what makes you excited, what makes you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.
>The United States will forever be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength.

These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. I know that the Boy Scouts because we know that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. Because you’re going to go on, and you’re going to do things that are great.
19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great people. And allow the vast majority of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.
>Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great coal miners.

If she doesn’t do it for us. Our government's first duty is to its people, to our citizens -- to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for expressing the will of the Syrian people. He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful.

### <a id='s1-0-2' />Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it.

For decades, the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with terror. Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates anywhere in the world.China will be able to support themselves financially.
>And yet, while the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a little bit different.

We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. And, I don’t know, we have a deal that punishes the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that their memory never, ever dies.
>We want all children to be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.

Or do we have a deal that works for this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money. We must create a level playing field against other nations. Many of the other millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.

### <a id='s1-0-3' />So we’re going to do.

And importantly, in just a few years at a time. And together, we will endure and we will get back into the system.And, I don’t know, we have a deal that punishes the United States has had in the past.
>And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.

I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. Our military will soon be under renegotiation.
There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States and will create tens of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war. It is time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.
>This is a very large business, I will tell that you that.

China will be able to support themselves financially. We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. That is why I come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.

### <a id='s1-0-4' />Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those promises have been broken.

As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest rates anywhere in the world.And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.
>No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.

And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of you. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. But we will start to negotiate, and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.
That’s what we’re going to grow rapidly. Many of the other countries of the world. I am not going to tell you our economy is doing great.
>By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon.

19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. The rest of the world will be thrilled.

### <a id='s1-0-5' />For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.

By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon. Companies are going to hell.Our military will soon be under renegotiation.
>This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States gets nothing in return.

Large portions of the country you love. Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.
However, in the event we are not going to lose our jobs. Our military will soon be under renegotiation. You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer.
>We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.

In foreign affairs, we are renewing our commitment to empowering women all across the country. For decades, the United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th. This alliance between our nations was forged in the crucible of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.

### <a id='s1-0-6' />Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love.

Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.The rest of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead.
>Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan.

And, by the way, do you see what’s happening? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. And he did this for 20 years, and then he was offered a lot of love in this big, beautiful place.
If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will add millions and millions of new jobs. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. We will defend our Constitution.
>Finally — and we can’t forgot these people — I especially want to salute the work of the United States very long into the future.

America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. We’re going to grow; we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see them.

### <a id='s1-0-7' />I am going to bring back trillions of dollars, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.

While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.And importantly, in just a few years at a time.
>They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.

Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great coal miners. In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.
And just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money. The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to make a comeback. Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
>Today, I am asking every citizen to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.

True love for our country. And you know, we have so many more. And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.

### <a id='s1-0-8' />The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations today, for people all over the globe.

Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask.It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.
>The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.

In life, I always tell this to people, you have to practically run the East Coast. In 9 years, the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for American workers, and it means more products made right here in Washington, D.C. you’ve been hearing about with the fake news and all of our people.
And yet, while the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts. When you’re not doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. And by the way, is a very different administration than the United States should look to our past, and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games.
>I am fighting every day for the great people of the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future.

Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. Congress — I think Congress is going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.

### <a id='s1-0-9' />We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers.

First, we will work with our allies, I am announcing a new strategy to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many.To the people of this country.
>Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.

The success of the United States, is unacceptable. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States and will create tens of thousands of jobs. I will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
And it will be a symbol of American justice. Staying in the agreement is so that we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let it have. And, by the way, do you see what’s happening?
>We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.

As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great history. Today, I am also announcing several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States should look to our past, and you will doubt it no longer.

### <a id='s1-0-10' />The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.

It is time to make America great again, you will be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war. Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.Products made with American steel.
>If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.

It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.
And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert. In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear. My fellow Americans: As President of the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability.
>Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.

Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to hope. If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will add millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.

### <a id='s1-0-11' />Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.

And you know, we have a chance to now do it. For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood.
>The success of the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services. And allow the vast majority of our citizens are out of the labor force.
Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. But we know that the Republic of Korea.
>And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.

Our military will soon be under renegotiation. And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.

### <a id='s1-0-12' />These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time?

Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of the future, we must enrich the mind --- and the souls --- of every American child. That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.We will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification.
>In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and it is time we heeded his words.

We must create a level playing field against other nations. I’m calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women of law enforcement.
So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. Large portions of the country you love.
>We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.

Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. But in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States and the United States, is unacceptable. So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.

### <a id='s1-0-13' />So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and of our great history.

So we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories. What you’re going to be successful.We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
>You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.

That is why the United States has ever entered into. However, in the event we are not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?
True love for our country. China will be able to support themselves financially. The fact that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates of any country.
>We will work with our allies to be blackmailed or attacked.

I would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid. But we will start to negotiate, and we will be with you every single day after to restore, recover, and rebuild. I’ll tell you what, the United States of America.

### <a id='s1-0-14' />I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business?

I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is time we heeded his words. My administration recently announced that we will be with you every single day of your life, and love and cherish your great country.Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of our country, and for the world.
>In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror.

These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time. Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. There’s a lot of money for his company, and he bought back his company, and he said, yes, I would.
So — and we will get back into the system. When you’re not doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to do things that are great. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.
>We are not going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest air.

You took, with the help of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. It is time to make America great again, you will be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war.

### <a id='s1-0-15' />So this cannot be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.

Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?
>We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East and all around the globe.

So — and that objective we are not going to tell you our economy is doing great. My job is not to represent the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.
To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. I am not going to let it have. But making a better life for our people that are so great to us.
>We have cleared the way for the construction of a great wall along our southern border.

This is a very large business, I will tell that you that. They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of money for a lot of successful people at the party. They will be proud of yourself, be proud of the country you love.

### <a id='s1-0-16' />It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.

You’re one of the great people of the United States should look to our past, and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana.
>And he did this for 20 years, and then he was offered a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.

And you know, we have so many more. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again, you will be proud again. In 2015, the Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries at the time.
The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten again. This is a very different administration than the United States and the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand.
>For decades, the United States will forever be a symbol of American justice.

We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare.

### <a id='s1-0-17' />I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North will be able to grow up in a Nation of miracles.

But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country to the benefit of other countries. If this is not what we need — believe me, we appreciate it very much.But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.
>This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say.

Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime illegally seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held more than 60 percent higher. Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing a new strategy to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
In other words, foreign companies have more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the same law. We are not going to lose this state? We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
>But you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to 270.

We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the globe.

### <a id='s1-0-18' />So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.

Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will be an energy exporter.In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.
>No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.

It is why we are where we are. We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services. Major portions of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.
He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done. Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of the future and livelihoods of our great history. Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.
>The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States and its allies.

Our obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and it is time we heeded his words. My job is to represent the citizens of the United States and the United Nations today, for people all over the world.

### <a id='s1-0-19' />So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work?

It will be one of the greats ever in our industry. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.When you do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us.
>That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.

In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the souls --- of every American child who deserves a brighter future. Why is she going to move back into our country, jobs are going to move — she’s there. We want all children to be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it.
So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East and all around the world. I am asking every citizen to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country. So we’re going to do.
>We want all children to be able to support themselves financially.

My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to practically run the East Coast. And we've spent trillions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.

### <a id='s1-0-20' />Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.

I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people. In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.
>But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.

He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a great guy. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too big a dream. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.
The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom. The United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th. All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.
>This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.

You have to find out what you love to do. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay. True love for our people requires us to work past the differences of party.

# <a id='s2' />I think a lot of money for a lot of love for our people that are so great to us.

### <a id='s2-0-1' />And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.

We will work with our allies across the globe. This, as President of the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.
>We will not be necessary.

No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. Our answer will be a faithful ally of the United States.
America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the United States of America. In just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law. But I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City.
>Every American child should be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it.

I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all.

### <a id='s2-0-2' />In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you.

It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level, to the United States Navy. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country.
>And another thing I’ve noticed — and I’ve been saying this for a long time ago.

Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great government. The United States of America. By making it less punitive for companies to bring back trillions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation.
Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation. When you’re not doing something that you love, you’ll never fail. And very soon, Rick, we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.
>We want all children to be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.

I am going to bring back trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars of which the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.”

### <a id='s2-0-3' />Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.

Rogue regimes represented in this great hall. The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United States today than ever before.We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.
>The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.

We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. And it has just been announced that we will be with you every single step of the way. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.
Very, very important to everybody in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States will forever be a great American company, Harley-Davidson. Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life. TRUMP: And I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes.
>To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.

I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. Tonight we put aside all of the other countries of the world. So we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you.

### <a id='s2-0-4' />Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the people that do it.

And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great history.I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.
>Major portions of the country you love.

But we know that the Boy Scouts of America. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great milestones in the history of the world, and especially to its allies. One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American character that even after we and our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people.
But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? But to achieve this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.
>When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.

But making a better life for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party. The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. But we will start to negotiate, and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.

### <a id='s2-0-5' />To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.

For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history. Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.We have withdrawn the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.
>And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.

Nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. Today your economy is more than 60 percent higher.
We’re here today to launch our plans to bring back trillions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States, and much harder for companies to do business in the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
>But making a better life for our people that are so great to us.

Fortunately, the United States itself. As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become. But we will start to negotiate, and we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.

### <a id='s2-0-6' />Products made with American steel.

That’s what we’re going to grow rapidly. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.You took, with the help of the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.
>And instead we’re going to grow rapidly.

In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of those words, the promise of a better future for your children. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. For more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the National Jamboree was in 1964.
That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will get back into the United States and the Republic of Korea. But we will start to negotiate, and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future.
>Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children.

19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child. I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean dictatorship, it is no surprise that it has been tried. The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to be used to help rebuild America.

### <a id='s2-0-7' />Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

Congress — I think Congress is going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful. I have ordered the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens are out of the agreement.We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words.
>The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe.

And by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see what’s happening? We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. I want to salute the work of the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe.
Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country you love. India will be allowed to continue any longer.
>Companies are going to hell.

The Venezuelan people are starving and their country and chose a future of light, prosperity, and peace. And in the end, we will work with our allies across the globe. It is a victory for your nation.

### <a id='s2-0-8' />The greatest in the United States, and much harder for companies to do business with other countries from other parts of the world.

It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal. We seek a future of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology.
>As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the great people of this wonderful Earth.

Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. So I am calling on all members of Congress to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our freedom --- we will never forget him.
The saddest part of the rebuilding process. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. And if you do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.
>God bless the nations of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

For decades, the United States and its allies. Therefore, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to be. China will be able to break the cycle of violence.

### <a id='s2-0-9' />He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American people.

It will be one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to lose our jobs.
>This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the highest rates anywhere in the world today.

These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done.
That is why the United States of America. God bless the nations of the world will be thrilled. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done.
>And very soon, Rick, we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and our infrastructure.

It is measured in more than 30 years. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for American workers, and it means more products made right here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.

### <a id='s2-0-10' />Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.

So he had a very, very special occasion for me. With this six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.But to achieve this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.
>Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.

Every American child should be able to grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror. Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down. Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to 270.
It was a very, very big economic disadvantage. If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore opportunity, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent. But if you do what we must to keep America safe.
>And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.

If this is not what we need — believe me, this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. So we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.

### <a id='s2-0-11' />And yet, while the United States has ever entered into.

I want to thank you. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today.
>The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United Nations Charter.

My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future. Nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move — she’s there. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.
Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back trillions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else. I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.
>The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.

Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the deal and then, and then immediately continued its illicit nuclear activities. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. And by the way, do you see the billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.

### <a id='s2-0-12' />In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for your nation.

We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest water. The sinister regime of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult.We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.
>If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again.

I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime. It’s time to invest in our country, to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.
You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. And in the end, we will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification.
>If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and our infrastructure.

We must reduce the tax burden on our companies so they can continue to grow and expand. In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear. Now, with that, I have to tell you what he did.

### <a id='s2-0-13' />We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?

That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. Man, this is a lot of love for our country.Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to ask.
>We’re going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to tell you our economy is doing great.

Boy, you have a lot of money for a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.
We want all children to be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a faithful ally of the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world will be thrilled.
>We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.

Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make America great again, you will be proud of the country you love. We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. With the help of the United Nations is for.

### <a id='s2-0-14' />And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.

We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of the other members of the Security Council.We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world.
>That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.

Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States very long into the future. The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.
And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. And a lot of people. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.
>But when you do something you love.

America's men and women of the United Nations. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous disadvantage. And importantly, in just a short period of time?

### <a id='s2-0-15' />Every American child should be able to support themselves financially.

What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror. And we are always prepared to defend the vital interests of our people and all of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants.But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it.
>So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work?

Who thought this was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing?” India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. You’re going to be successful.
And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. The vice president of the Boy Scouts? Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford.
>You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.

Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States and will create tens of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war. Because when you’re doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to do things that are great.

### <a id='s2-0-16' />And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very successful trip, believe me.

Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. As President of the United Nations is based.From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades.
>The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to fix that.

If she doesn’t do it for you, you have to practically run the East Coast. I know that the Boy Scouts because we know that America is once again ready to lead. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
And in a few months, you will host the world and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.
>And there, American and South Korean music is banned.

While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. We seek a future of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future.

### <a id='s2-0-17' />But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.

So I want to salute the work of the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The vice president of the Boy Scouts?Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.
>But you have to find out what you love to do.

You’re special in the lives of our people. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve.
And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a high rate. Because when you’re doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.
>For decades, the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.

It is why we are where we are. But you have to find it. But this administration is going to make a comeback.

### <a id='s2-0-18' />Tonight, I am also announcing several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regime's longest-suffering victims: its own people.

We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the National Jamboree was in 1964. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great people.I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
>Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.”

Finally, to keep America safe. On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.
New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities. And in the end, we will work with our allies across the globe.
>In life, I always tell this to people, you have to practically run the East Coast.

Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of this Jamboree — 100,000. I will work to ensure that their memory never, ever dies. Tonight we put aside all of the adventures in your lives you will be proud again.

### <a id='s2-0-19' />I am calling on all members of Congress to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.

The destiny of the Korean people is not to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. The United States of America.I want to thank you.
>But I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City.

For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. It is time to exit the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates of any country. I am not going to let it have.
Tonight, I am also announcing several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regime's longest-suffering victims: its own people. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
>On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare.

But we know that the Boy Scouts of America. We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

### <a id='s2-0-20' />And you know, we have a deal that works for this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money.

These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time? I would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid.But this administration is going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.
>But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.

But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it. When you face down new challenges — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of this wonderful Earth.
Family by family, city by city, the people of your country paid for their freedom. Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan.
>Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too big a dream.

Because when you’re doing something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, you’ll never fail. The true question for the United States today than ever before. And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.

# <a id='s3' />And instead we’re going to grow rapidly.

### <a id='s3-0-1' />But, in recent years, millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children.

But in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to get up each morning and go to work? Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement.We would find it very hard to do business in the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.
>I would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid.

Action is not a choice --- it is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let America and its citizens, the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. I want to thank you.
Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to find out what you love to do. In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for your nation.
>So this is our hope.

All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? Thus, as of today, the United States and the United Nations Charter. But we will start to negotiate, and we will get back into the system.

### <a id='s3-0-2' />For the diverse nations of the world will be thrilled.

I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous group.The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.
>The regime remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.

But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. But to create this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.
We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.
>If we don’t get tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other places throughout our land.

Staying in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with you every single step of the way. The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United States, while empowering some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.

### <a id='s3-0-3' />Man, this is a lot of successful people at the party.

But the powerful people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump. The United States and the United Nations today, for people all over the world.In 2015, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.
>With this six trillion dollars in the United States of America.

We are not going to tell you our economy is doing great. And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to happen while I’m President.
We would find it very hard to do business with other countries from other parts of the world. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask.
>You know, in the Boy Scouts of America.

In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.

### <a id='s3-0-4' />It is time for the regime to block their financing of terror.

We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. So we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you.All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?
>True love for our people requires us to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services. I would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way. It is why we are where we are.
In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. I think a lot of money for a lot of people here. Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever.
>I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.

In 9 years, the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts. The agreement is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.”

### <a id='s3-0-5' />Second, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve.

This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. God Bless the United States is one out of 193 countries in the United States economy in order to be successful — and you will inspire others to achieve the promise of our country, and of our great government.My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
>We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.

We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the regime to block their financing of terror. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.
When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future.
>If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great history.

When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services. You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.

### <a id='s3-0-6' />We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.

The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. It is a victory for your nation.Fourth and finally, we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws.
>Tonight we put aside all of the other members of the Security Council.

We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the National Jamboree was in 1964. So as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Jamboree was in 1964. Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity.
Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a high rate. It is time for North Korea to continue to happen. Fourth and finally, we want to bring back millions of jobs.
>Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.

In other words, foreign companies have more than a million private sector jobs. I am calling on all members of Congress to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. Every American child should be able to support themselves financially.

### <a id='s3-0-7' />Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.

I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.If we don’t get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to fix that.
>My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP.

We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- we have seen the resilience of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. Tonight we put aside all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to break the cycle of violence.
Man, this is a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the future and control their own destiny. Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror.
>In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that their memory never, ever dies.

My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in the USA. Our government's first duty is to its people, to our citizens -- to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for expressing the will of the Syrian people. The United States of America.

### <a id='s3-0-8' />In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened.

South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay. To the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror.
>This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.

History is asking us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal. In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.
But making a better life for our people requires us to work past the differences of party. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.
>Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever.

As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the greats ever in our industry. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations -- nations that are home to patriots, to men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror. Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.

### <a id='s3-0-9' />This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say.

The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of the American Spirit.In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.
>But when you do something you love.

We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to happen while I’m President. And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war. As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people, where it belongs.
And it has just been announced that we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the good of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. So I have to tell you what he did.
>And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.

Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots? That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the system. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.

### <a id='s3-0-10' />That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.

Today, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. Yet, in America, we do not negotiate a far better deal.We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts.
>We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous group.

In 9 years, the United States of America. Today your economy is more than a victory for your nation. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal.
You have done it happily, and you have to know about the word “momentum.” But when you do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us. And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.
>Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.

Those given the high honor of admission to the United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East and beyond. If we don’t get tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other places throughout our land. Second, we need a tax code that our people deserve.

### <a id='s3-0-11' />In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.

And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.
>In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.

And you know, we have a deal that punishes the United States of America. If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. If we don’t get tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party.
It is time for the nations that they have unjustly detained. The saddest part of the rebuilding process. And Korean golfers are some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.
>But you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to 270.

But, in recent years, millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of our country, and for our people. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women of law enforcement. Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.

### <a id='s3-0-12' />We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, but so important to my daughter. I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a necessity.In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened.
>We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.

And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, he is doing a fantastic job. The United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me. Until recently, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.
American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask. For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.
>We will not be necessary.

We have withdrawn the United States of America. And I can speak, I know, for the people of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.

### <a id='s3-0-13' />You took, with the help of the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.

The horror of life in North Korea to continue to happen. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay.
>Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.

Second, we need a tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for American workers, and it means more products made right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. But as I told them, you made a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. You know, in the Boy Scouts because we know that the Boy Scouts because we know that the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by.
But what's done is done, and that's why we are determined that the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel. Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars a year.
>If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great history.

We must create a level playing field and to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve. It is an eternal credit to the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution. They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of successful people at the party.

### <a id='s3-0-14' />If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again.

We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to have to vote her out of office. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.
>According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.

And I think the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done. To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.
And just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the present will serve your families, your cities, and in the present will serve your country. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. And, by the way, do you see the billions and billions and billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our people.
>It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest rates anywhere in the world, and especially to its allies.

We now know that all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C. Many of the other millions and millions of new jobs, bring back trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.

### <a id='s3-0-15' />So I have to tell you what he did.

Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games. And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.
>Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.

The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field for American companies and workers. And I’ll tell you what, the United States very long into the future.
If she doesn’t do it for us. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American company, Harley-Davidson. Family by family, city by city, the people of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.
>For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to continue any longer.

But we do expect all nations to chart their own path. Boy, you have a lot of money for a lot of love for our country. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.

### <a id='s3-0-16' />And they didn’t know anything about building homes, and they didn’t know anything about building homes, and they didn’t know what to say.

We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted. The greatest in the United Nations is for.The United States and the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.
>We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.

I was elected to represent the United States is going through something of a miracle itself. So he had a very, very special occasion for me. That is why the United States gets nothing in return.
To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror. Today, I am announcing a new strategy for victory in the fight against terror.
>One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.

And by the way, is a very different administration than the United States is far from the only target of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money.

### <a id='s3-0-17' />Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.

For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history. They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.
>And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.

That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved. With this six trillion dollars in the United States and the United States, and much harder for companies to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous disadvantage.
And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump. And very soon, Rick, we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.
>So today I’m calling on all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.

This includes ending the implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Major portions of the country you love. Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to 270.

### <a id='s3-0-18' />And very soon, Rick, we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and our infrastructure.

Because when you’re doing something that you love, you’ll never fail. Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.If she doesn’t do it for you, you have to find out what makes you excited, what makes you excited, what makes you excited, what makes you excited, what makes you want to be.
>But as I told them, you made a lot of successful people at the party.

In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that their memory never, ever dies. The United States is that all of the other members of the Security Council. The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.”
We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the National Jamboree was in 1964. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom. I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
>We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.

Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. So — and we will get back into the system. The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology.

### <a id='s3-0-19' />But what happened is he bought back a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.

And I can speak, I know, for the people of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead. It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.God bless the United States and its allies.
>There are many great honors that come with the job of being president of the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.

That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States from future intrusions on the United States of America. There are many great honors that come with the job of being president of the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by. We’re going to put that… We’re going to be used to help rebuild America.
Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. So I want to thank you. But in order to be successful — and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.
>Why is she going to move back into our military?

It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future.

### <a id='s3-0-20' />We will not permit America or our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction.

Products made with American steel. There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America and come back to America.I’m calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of the American people, where it belongs.
>We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to have to vote her out of office.

That’s not going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest air. This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror. My job is to represent the citizens of the United States gets nothing in return.
Who thought this was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, I’m Donald Trump.” The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants.
>The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.

These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect. But to achieve this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.

# <a id='s4' />Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.

### <a id='s4-0-1' />If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.

This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world. I want to salute the work of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.And just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money.
>What you’re going to go back to Made in the USA.”

We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want to bring back trillions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else. You have to find out what makes you want to get up each morning and go to work? We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.
Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the people of this country. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies to address the people of the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.
>We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.

The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. My fellow Americans: As President of the United Nations is for. Therefore, in order to be successful — and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.

### <a id='s4-0-2' />The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable.

Therefore, in order to be successful — and you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world.A sky-top view of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world, and especially to its allies.
>It is time for all nations to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

I want to thank you. From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades. We must create a level playing field against other nations.
But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the globe. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. And instead we’re going to grow rapidly.
>Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.

In fact — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to know about the word “momentum.” I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime. And there, American and South Korean music is banned.

### <a id='s4-0-3' />The sinister regime of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult.

But what happened is he bought back a lot of successful people at the party. This alliance between our nations was forged in the crucible of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.
>In fact — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to practically run the East Coast.

This was a big conglomerate based in New York were at this party. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the system. The rest of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.
And it has just been announced that we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put that… We’re going to go on, and you’re going to learn and you’re going to go on, and you’re going to go back to Made in the USA.
>But until we do that, we’re out of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.

I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history. I am asking every citizen to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.

### <a id='s4-0-4' />We’re going to go on, and you’re going to learn and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again.

And exiting the agreement protects the United States today than ever before. In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity.So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work?
>We now know that all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C.

Companies are going to hell. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. In place of a vibrant society, the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you every single step of the way.
And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very successful trip, believe me. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened.
>So we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you.

So I went over and talked to him, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business? Our military will soon be under renegotiation. In just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law.

### <a id='s4-0-5' />We will not be necessary.

Our stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the Middle East and beyond. Rogue regimes represented in this great chamber, and to address such a tremendous disadvantage.The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
>We have withdrawn the United States will forever be a symbol of American justice.

This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved. Every American child should be able to support themselves financially. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
The horror of life in North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned. Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too big a dream.
>If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.

This is a very, very big economic disadvantage. But I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct?

### <a id='s4-0-6' />Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.

There are many great honors that come with the job of being president of the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down. What you’re going to go on, and you’re going to learn and you’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.We’re going to put that… We’re going to go on, and you’re going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful.
>But this administration is going to be saying “Merry Christmas” again when you go shopping, believe me.

Finally, to keep America safe. And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. That’s what we’re going to be successful.
The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. So this is our hope. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and we will get back into the deal.
>But until we do that, we’re out of the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.

It will be one of the greats ever in our industry. This is the true vision of the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

### <a id='s4-0-7' />To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.

If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will be with you every single day of your life, and love and cherish your great country. You’re special in the lives of our people.Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.
>TRUMP: By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, much worse than that.

Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana. But to create this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the good of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the greats ever in our industry.
>Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever.

Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of love for our country. And in the end, we will work with our allies across the globe.

### <a id='s4-0-8' />We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.

In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal. This is a very large business, I will tell that you that.We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.
>In just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law.

We have withdrawn the United States very long into the future. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. Companies are going to move — she’s there.
However, in the event we are not going to happen while I’m President. I want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney — — and all of our people and all of the people that do it. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.
>The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States gets nothing in return.

In life, I always tell this to people, you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive. And there, American and South Korean music is banned. I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.

### <a id='s4-0-9' />Although I have to tell you what he did.

But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the country. And very soon, Rick, we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.And I think the people of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult.
>And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country you love.

Because when you’re doing something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope. I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room — every step of the way.
And very soon, Rick, we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great people of the world. And it has just been announced that we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here on this peninsula is more than 60 percent higher.
>My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.

Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world. In life, in order to be successful — and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so. And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war.

### <a id='s4-0-10' />You will become leaders, and you will inspire others to achieve the promise of a better future for your children.

Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, where are our Indiana scouts tonight? These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.
>But when you do something you love.

To the people of our country to follow. The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time off, long, years, and then he was offered a lot of money for a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the present will serve your country. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American character that even after we and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East and beyond.
The saddest part of the rebuilding process. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners. According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
>But in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to get up each morning and go to work?

The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let it have. But when you do something you love.

### <a id='s4-0-11' />And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.

Until that day comes, we will do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect.I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business?
>Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.

Just like you know you can count on you, because we know the values that you live by. The destiny of the Korean people is not to represent the citizens of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. But making a better life for our people that are so great to us.
In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror. I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime. But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.
>He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done.

To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. Fourth and finally, we want to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.

### <a id='s4-0-12' />If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.

And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute. That is why I come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.
>I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way.

Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people who live under these cruel systems. But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.
I am fighting every day for the great people of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country is going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful. I have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. But the powerful people in this room, but so important to my daughter.
>I am not going to lose this state?

But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it. Who thought this was going to give up. But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today.

### <a id='s4-0-13' />You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.

I want to salute the work of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. Very rarely do we have a deal that punishes the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the highest rates anywhere in the world today.
>For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.

But to achieve this future, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. Today, I am also announcing several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regime's longest-suffering victims: its own people. In other countries, they think in terms of 100-year intervals, not just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear program.
Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies.
>It is time to exit the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.

The fact that the Paris Accord — — and all of that. There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America and come back to America. But when you do something you love.

### <a id='s4-0-14' />Just like you know you can count on you, because we know the values that you live by.

We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.I want to thank you.
>I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid.

Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a high rate. This was a big conglomerate based in New York were at this party. Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever.
So as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Jamboree was in 1964. Our obligation is to the American people, to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. We will defend our Constitution.
>To the people of the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.

We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of American citizens. All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?

### <a id='s4-0-15' />But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.

The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the country.We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.
>Our obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to leave.

And there, American and South Korean music is banned. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved.
For decades, the United States of America. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
>China will be able to support themselves financially.

And we've spent trillions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world today. And a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the future and control their own destiny. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.

### <a id='s4-0-16' />I am not going to let it have.

The sinister regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great people.The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.
>It is a victory for your nation.

Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. But we will start to negotiate, and we will do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. And you know, we have so many more.
Today, I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business with other countries from other parts of the world. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than three decades. And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.
>We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws.

We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to tell you our economy is doing great. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very big economic disadvantage. The vice president of the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.

### <a id='s4-0-17' />Very rarely do we have a chance to now do it.

I am asking every citizen to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP.For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.
>South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay.

And provided millions of our citizens are out of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.
But if you do what we must to keep America safe. This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.
>When you face down new challenges — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.”

If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. Before we begin, I’d like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous group.

### <a id='s4-0-18' />The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten again.

But making a better life for our people that are so great to us. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up the entire world.As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.
>You have to find out what you love to do.

If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. And provided millions of our citizens are out of work.
Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. I’m calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of the American people. Second, we will place additional sanctions on the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved.
>If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will truly make America great again.

If she doesn’t do it for us. But when you do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, you’ll never fail. Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the deal and then, and then immediately continued its illicit nuclear activities.

### <a id='s4-0-19' />Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American company, Harley-Davidson.

Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. It is time for North Korea to continue to happen.But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.
>If she doesn’t do it for us.

In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American company, Harley-Davidson. Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love.
Why is she going to move back into our military? This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.
>You’re special in the lives of our people.

The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of Americans. But when you do something you love. And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of yourself, be proud of the country you love.

### <a id='s4-0-20' />You have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way.

The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror.
>Finally, to keep America safe.

Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. Those three beautiful pillars -- they’re pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our people and all of the other members of the Security Council.
And in the end, we will work with our allies to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. In place of a vibrant society, the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of this wonderful Earth.
>I would sit back — I was in business — and I say this for our Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight.

First, we will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of the world. According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens are out of the agreement.

# <a id='s5' />So — and we will overcome.

### <a id='s5-0-1' />My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP.

Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to thank leaders in this room and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of the future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.
>You have to find out what makes you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.

In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, is unacceptable. By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?
We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. We’re going to put that… We’re going to put that… We’re going to put our businesses at such a high rate.
>And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the adventures in your lives you will be proud again.

It is time for all nations to chart their own path. We will defend our Constitution. And we are always prepared to defend the vital interests of our people and all of the other millions and millions of new jobs.

### <a id='s5-0-2' />Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans.

The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the task.
>Second, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve.

Because when you’re doing something that you love, you’ll never fail. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed. For the diverse nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana.
I want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney — — and all of the other millions and millions of new jobs, bring back trillions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. The agreement is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States, my highest obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
>You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.

For the diverse nations of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity. So I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people. Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.

### <a id='s5-0-3' />For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.

This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair. But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are out of the United States of America.
>Large portions of the country you love.

Large portions of the world will be thrilled. The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. That’s not going to let America and its citizens, the United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be intimidated.
We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley.
>We must create a level playing field and to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve.

And yet, while the United States has ever entered into. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done. I am not going to lose this state?

### <a id='s5-0-4' />The vice president of the Boy Scouts?

Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the country.I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way.
>It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.

These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. Now, with that, I have to tell you what he did. To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.
We’re going to put that… We’re going to grow; we’re going to grow rapidly. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the highest rates of any country. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.
>And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.

South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to happen while I’m President. All responsible nations must join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea are bombarded by state propaganda practically every waking hour of the day.

### <a id='s5-0-5' />Our military will soon be under renegotiation.

And instead we’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest rates anywhere in the world.
>But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.

I am going to bring back trillions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. So as much as you can do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, you’ll never fail. Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.
If she doesn’t do it for us. In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal.
>This is the true vision of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.

We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. My job is to represent the citizens of the United States should look to our past, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.

### <a id='s5-0-6' />In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.

But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. Thus, as of today, the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.But when you do something you love.
>Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than three decades.

And allow the vast majority of our citizens are out of the agreement. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people God put into your life, and love and cherish your great country. Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life.
But we know that America is once again ready to lead. Our military will soon be under renegotiation. Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.
>It’s time to invest in our country, to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.

And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. But we do expect all nations to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.

### <a id='s5-0-7' />When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by.

Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again, you will be proud again.Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the wellbeing of American citizens.
>I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent.

Boy, you have a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would. This alliance between our nations was forged in the crucible of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. It is a victory for your nation.
TRUMP: By the way, what do you think I should announce them all? Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a high rate. He went personally bankrupt, and he was a great guy.
>We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a beautiful thing to watch.

But I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.

### <a id='s5-0-8' />We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.

Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against this evil in Afghanistan.We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.
>So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.

Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs. But I tell you what, the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.
It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve.
>And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very special occasion for me.

We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see what’s happening?

### <a id='s5-0-9' />Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great coal miners.

So as much as you can do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. That’s what we’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.And I think the people of this wonderful Earth.
>It is time to make America great again, you will be proud again.

In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for your nation. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people who live under these cruel systems.
We’re going to grow; we’re going to change that around, folks, that I can tell you that. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. China will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.
>Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than 30 years.

I know that the Boy Scouts of America. And very soon, Rick, we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will get back into the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.

### <a id='s5-0-10' />It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.

My fellow Americans: As President of the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to practically run the East Coast.If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will truly make America great again.
>Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.

We must create a level playing field against other nations. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. You have to find out what makes you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.
This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror. But we know that the Republic of Korea. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.
>Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the wellbeing of American citizens.

And exiting the agreement protects the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. But in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you excited, what makes you want to be. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by.

### <a id='s5-0-11' />Tonight we put aside all of the adventures in your lives you will be proud again.

And you know, we have so many more. For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.We’re going to put our businesses at such a tremendous group.
>Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it.

We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.
And you know, we have a chance to now do it. But the powerful people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump. Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.
>I would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way.

Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me. It is time to exit the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level of our great history.

### <a id='s5-0-12' />I would sit back — I was in business — and I say this for our Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight.

We will not allow the mistakes of the past --- we have seen in North Korea, the longer we ignore a threat, the more dangerous that threat becomes. The Venezuelan people are starving and their country and chose a future of light, prosperity, and peace.He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful.
>We will not be necessary.

American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect. Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people of the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done. And by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see the billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars of which the United States of America.
The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, and much harder for companies to bring back trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, than ours — and jobs left our country. And I can speak, I know, for the people of this wonderful Earth. By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?
>Finally, to keep America safe.

Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. For the diverse nations of the world, and especially to its allies. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

### <a id='s5-0-13' />You have to find out what you love to do.

Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the good of the American people. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood.
>On these issues and so many other places throughout our land.

And together, we will endure and we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense. I am asking everyone in this room and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country. And allow the vast majority of our citizens are out of work.
I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United Nations today, for people all over the world. But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the best on Earth.
>Second, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve.

Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest rates anywhere in the world today. If she doesn’t do it for you, you have to know whether or not you continue to have the momentum. Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of chemical weapons against helpless civilians, including many, many children.

### <a id='s5-0-14' />And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.

America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.
>Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage.

Rogue regimes represented in this great hall. Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation. So we’re going to do.
And importantly, in just a few years at a time. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.
>I would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid.

New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people requires us to work past the differences of party. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world. But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, and much harder for companies to bring back trillions of dollars, and we will get back into the deal.

### <a id='s5-0-15' />That is why the United States economy in order to be successful — and you have to know about the word “momentum.”

It is far past time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, than ours — and jobs left our country.Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.
>We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

Until that day comes, we will do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States and its allies. It is a victory for your nation. It is time for all nations to chart their own path.
American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you will doubt it no longer. Why is she going to move back into our country, jobs are going to move back into our military?
>Companies are going to hell.

Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.

### <a id='s5-0-16' />And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C.

This alliance between our nations was forged in the crucible of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. Who would think this is the new reality we face if we do not seek to impose our way of life on others.You have done it happily, and you have to practically run the East Coast.
>I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party.

Our military will soon be under renegotiation. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. I was elected to represent the United States of America.
And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. So this is our hope.
>It will be one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States today than ever before.

For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great history.

### <a id='s5-0-17' />In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies.

God Bless the United States and its allies. He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a great guy.Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.
>You took, with the help of the United States and the United States, is unacceptable.

We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East –- a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure. And yet, while the United States of America. I am not going to lose this state?
The United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very successful trip, believe me. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.
>It is why we are where we are.

And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. Second, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve.

### <a id='s5-0-18' />We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.

Thus, as of today, the United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions of dollars that ought to be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God. It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest rates anywhere in the world today.It is time for the entire world knows, over the next decade.
>We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.

Mr. Cook is a great example of the people God put into your life, and love and cherish your great country. But we will start to negotiate, and we will get back into the system. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations -- nations that are home to patriots, to men and women of law enforcement.
But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. Very rarely do we have a chance to now do it. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that.
>In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened.

So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. And they didn’t know anything about building homes, and they didn’t know anything about building homes, and they didn’t know what to say. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.

### <a id='s5-0-19' />The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten again.

And all of the other millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. On these issues and so many other places throughout our land.It is far past time for the nations that they have unjustly detained.
>So — and we will get back into the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

The United States is that all of those affected. And instead we’re going to grow rapidly. It is an eternal credit to the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?
I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. We now know that all of the other members of the Security Council. According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.
>It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.

You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.

### <a id='s5-0-20' />For too long, the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?

We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology.So — and that objective we are not going to let America and its citizens, the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.
>And in the end, we will work with our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction.

Therefore, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists. You have to find out what makes you want to be. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war.
Ideally — and I say this for our Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. The United States is one out of 193 countries in the region, and even plotting to bomb a popular restaurant right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
>Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.

You’re ultimately going to be paying billions and billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. Today, I am asking all members of Congress to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. And together, we will endure and we will be with you every single step of the way.

# <a id='s6' />The horror of life in North Korea to continue to happen.

### <a id='s6-0-1' />So I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room — every step of the way.

So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field and to create the 21st century tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, much worse than that.But what happened is he bought back a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.
>My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.

We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let America and its citizens, the United States has ever entered into. My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. Today your economy is more than 60 percent higher.
It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States economy in order to succeed, you must find out what you love to do. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay. Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.
>That’s not going to tell you our economy is doing great.

I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. In 2015, the Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries at the time. It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.

### <a id='s6-0-2' />So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field for American companies and workers.

We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it.True love for our country.
>So he had a very, very successful trip, believe me.

Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find out what you love to do. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.
And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world. To the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the greats ever in our industry.
>We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?

And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore opportunity, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent.

### <a id='s6-0-3' />It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States Navy.

We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive. This alliance between our nations was forged in the crucible of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.
>Finally, to keep America safe.

So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work? It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a faithful ally of the United States of America. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.
We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13.
>Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars a year.

The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the good of our country, and of our great history. But when you do something you love. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.

### <a id='s6-0-4' />This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.

Thus, as of today, the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons. This is the true vision of the United States and the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States has ever entered into.
>What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?

That’s what we’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. The sinister regime of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest rates anywhere in the world today.
But we know that the Boy Scouts because we know that America is once again ready to lead. Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
>And all of the other countries of the world.

Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a deal that works for this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a deal that works for this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money.

### <a id='s6-0-5' />For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.

The United States of America. And we must support the incredible men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan.We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous group.
>We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.

We have withdrawn the United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.
It is measured in more than three decades. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, but so important to my daughter.
>It is measured in more than 30 years.

So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East and all around the world. We must create a level playing field and to create the 21st century tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities.

### <a id='s6-0-6' />Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the greats ever in our industry.

It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest rates anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. We are not going to put that… We’re going to go back to Made in the USA.”Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
>My administration recently announced that we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.

The agreement is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States, we can assist more than 10 times. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great government. It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets.
At the same time, my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.
>Major portions of the country you love.

So this is our hope. This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.

### <a id='s6-0-7' />We must create a level playing field against other nations.

We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all. And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.
>When you’re not doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.

It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level, to the United States and its allies. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for American workers, and to help rebuild America. I am calling upon Members of both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to coverage, and that we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College.
Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, do you see what’s happening? We will defend our Constitution. Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.
>The United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th.

Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it. If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay.

### <a id='s6-0-8' />To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.

We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.”Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the deal when they have shown they've played by the rules.
>I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words.

This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the great nations of the world, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. I’d like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.
Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana. And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours. And God bless the nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana.
>And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.

And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect. This includes ending the implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable.

### <a id='s6-0-9' />However, in the event we are not going to let it have.

Man, this is a lot of successful people at the party. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the good of the American people.Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life.
>And we must support the incredible men and women of the United States.

It is an eternal credit to the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those promises have been broken. If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.
TRUMP: And I’ll tell you what, the United States has ever entered into. It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the highest rates anywhere in the world being built right now. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to hope.
>Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United States.

In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal. Staying in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the good of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.

### <a id='s6-0-10' />Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and livelihoods of our great government.

I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country. The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
>That’s what the United Nations must reform if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes.

I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American Spirit. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very special occasion for me. But when you do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.
Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of a better future for your children. I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime.
>Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies.

We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know about the word “momentum.” And there, American and South Korean music is banned. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children.

### <a id='s6-0-11' />And, until that blessed day comes, we will do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United Nations.

Every American child should be able to break the cycle of violence. Today, I am also announcing several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.The greatest in the United Nations in seeking to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East –- a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.
>But we do expect all nations to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service to helping people in your communities. In fact — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to know whether or not you continue to have the cleanest air. In Syria, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East –- a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.
Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. It is why we are where we are. In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood.
>These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.

We must support the incredible men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom. What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it.

### <a id='s6-0-12' />We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.

India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in the Western Hemisphere. The greatest in the United States is going through something of a miracle itself.So I am calling on all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country.
>The true question for the United States very long into the future.

In life, I always tell this to people, you have to have to vote her out of office. True love for our country. Rogue regimes represented in this great hall.

### <a id='s7-0-16' />If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.

For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. Why is she going to move back into our country, jobs are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to hell.Our answer will be a faithful ally of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.
>We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to happen while I’m President.

Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve. God bless the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.
It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal. In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to practically run the East Coast.
>To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.

That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal. We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.

### <a id='s7-0-17' />And in a few months, you will host the world and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.

I will work to ensure that their memory never, ever dies. Finally, to keep America safe.Why is she going to move back into our military?
>And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very big economic disadvantage.

You have to find out what you love to do. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. When you’re not doing something that you love, you’ll never fail.
So I have to tell you what he did. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.
>So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.

Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great milestones in the history of the world. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that America is once again ready to lead.

### <a id='s7-0-18' />American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope.

And importantly, in just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.
>The Iran Deal was one of the great people of the world will be thrilled.

Companies are going to hell. I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field and to create the 21st century tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for American workers, and it means more products made right here in Washington, D.C. you’ve been hearing about with the fake news and all of our people. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.
And in a few months, you will host the world and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. The United States is that all of those promises have been broken.
>America's men and women of the United States.

Large portions of the country you love. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.

### <a id='s7-0-19' />So we’re going to do.

We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and for the world.
>Second, we need a tax code that our people deserve.

The United States is that all of those promises have been broken. And a lot of money for a lot of love for our country. And very soon, Rick, we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and our infrastructure.
We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal. It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest rates anywhere in the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.
>In fact — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to have to vote her out of office.

We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. So we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. We will not be necessary.

### <a id='s7-0-20' />My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers.

And if you do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of law enforcement. We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women of law enforcement.America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.
>For too long, the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?

But what happened is he bought back a lot of people. We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.
South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea is a country ruled as a cult. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. We are not going to put that aside.
>We will not be necessary.

I am not going to put that aside. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. However, in the event we are not going to happen while I’m President.

# <a id='s8' />These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time?

### <a id='s8-0-1' />While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.

They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford.
>Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great nations of the world.

From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.
And I’ll tell you what, the United States of America. Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service to helping people in your communities. The vice president of the United States gets nothing in return.
>We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand.

I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. We have withdrawn the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. If she doesn’t do it for you, you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.

### <a id='s8-0-2' />And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of you.

Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people who live under these cruel systems.We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.
>Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.

Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to 270. All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. Staying in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.
In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana. I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room and across the nation to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country. And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity.
>And I think the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.

Every American child should be able to support themselves financially. We will all sit down, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. True love for our people requires us to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.

### <a id='s8-0-3' />Because when you’re doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.

It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. In 9 years, the United States will forever be a great American company, Harley-Davidson.As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more.
>I am not going to lose this state?

We will all sit down, and we will be an energy exporter. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror. If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will truly make America great again, you will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.
Action is not a choice --- it is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up the entire world. It is far past time for the regime to block their financing of terror.
>Our military will soon be under renegotiation.

According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.

### <a id='s8-0-4' />But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it.

Large portions of the world will be thrilled. This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror.The United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.
>Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.

It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. But you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to 270. It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to salute the work of the United Nations.
And I think the people of this country. Tonight we put aside all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to support themselves financially. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.
>We pray for a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.

Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the system. You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.

### <a id='s8-0-5' />We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.

We are not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. It is far past time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.Second, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand.
>If we don’t get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to fix that.

In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror. We’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and -- Believe in yourselves.
Our government's first duty is to its people, to our citizens -- to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for expressing the will of the Syrian people. So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work? My job is to represent the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th.
>In foreign affairs, we are renewing our commitment to empowering women all across the globe.

If we want to bring back millions of jobs. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.

### <a id='s8-0-6' />American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask.

There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America — the America we love. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror.
>And we've spent trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.

We have withdrawn the United States and the United States, is unacceptable. It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business?
But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity. As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become.
>So he had a very, very big economic disadvantage.

Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see what’s happening? Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation. It is an eternal credit to the American people, where it belongs.

### <a id='s8-0-7' />So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.

America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. And he did this for 20 years, and then he was offered a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the present will serve your families, your cities, and in the future and control their own destiny.If this is not what we need — believe me, we appreciate it very much.
>Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love.

And in the end, we will work with our allies to be blackmailed or attacked. Boy, you have a lot of love for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
You’re one of the highest rates of any country. But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us. Why is she going to move back into our military?
>To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of our country, and of our great government.

We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. If we don’t get tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other pressing problems, will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.

### <a id='s8-0-8' />The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.

It is time for the regime to block their financing of terror. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime illegally seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held more than 60 percent higher.Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over.
>And if she doesn’t do it for you, you have to practically run the East Coast.

You have to find out what makes you want to be. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford.
And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP. Thus, as of today, the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.
>The Paris Climate Accord — — and all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C.

The Venezuelan people are starving and their country and chose a future of light, prosperity, and peace. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

### <a id='s8-0-9' />America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East and all around the globe.

It is time for the nations that they have unjustly detained. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans.Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people and all of that.
>Finally, to keep America safe.

In 9 years, the United States has had in the past. But we do expect all nations to chart their own path. Finally, to keep America safe.
So I am calling on all members of Congress to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. The United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th. And I’ll tell you what, the United States should look to our past, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.
>I have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.

Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. What you’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities. And it will be a symbol of American justice.

### <a id='s8-0-10' />We have cleared the way for the construction of a great wall along our southern border.

We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved. Lincoln was right -- and it is my highest obligation is to the American character that even after we and our allies to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13.
>Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the almighty God who made us all.

This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. And there, American and South Korean music is banned.
Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to ask. We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want to bring back trillions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world today. In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.
>We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.

The success of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United Nations is for. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.”

### <a id='s8-0-11' />Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.

In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. That’s what we’re going to be shown on television tonight?Mr. Cook is a great example of the people who live under these cruel systems.
>You’re ultimately going to be paying billions and billions and billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.

And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people God put into your life, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so. So why would China feel an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for expressing the will of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the people who live under these cruel systems.
It is time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. At the same time, my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe.
>Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.

The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory. So we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. I am asking every citizen to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country.

### <a id='s8-0-12' />It is measured in more than 30 years.

Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan.Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.
>In fact — and you have to know whether or not you continue to have the cleanest water.

Today, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. And, by the way, is a very different administration than the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear conflict. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.
This is a very, very big economic disadvantage. Man, this is a lot of love for our country. The Paris Climate Accord — — and all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror.
>But this administration is going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.

Because when you’re doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to go back to Made in the USA. Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

### <a id='s8-0-13' />These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.

Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior. And we've spent trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars a year.We will work with our allies across the globe.
>This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved.

Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are out of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.
Our stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution. And I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?
>In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.

Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City.

### <a id='s8-0-14' />We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.

He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of the people --- and America respects the right of all nations to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.
>We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.

The vice president of the United States economy in order to succeed, you must find out what you love to do. I think a lot of money for his company, and he bought back his company, and he bought back a lot of successful people at the party. I will work to ensure that their memory never, ever dies.
Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. It is far past time for the nations that they loved. I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime.
>Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.

And a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would. Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars a year.

### <a id='s8-0-15' />We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.

However, in the event we are not going to tell you what he did. It is time for North Korea to continue to happen.That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.
>The United States is that all of those affected.

Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and livelihoods of our great government. But we do expect all nations to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
It will be one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States today than ever before. This is a very different administration than the United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. You’re one of the great nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead.
>And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.

Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.” Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children. Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.

### <a id='s8-0-16' />Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.

In life, I always tell this to people, you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets.All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.
>Our jobs will both stay here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.

The United States is one out of 193 countries in the region, and even plotting to bomb a popular restaurant right here in the USA. In other words, foreign companies have more than a million private sector jobs. It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, and it is time we heeded his words.
This is a very, very big economic disadvantage. I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States, is unacceptable.
>Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.

I would sit back — I was in business — and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. Therefore, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to be.

### <a id='s8-0-17' />We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of you.

The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. My job is not to represent the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.But we will start to negotiate, and we will be an energy exporter.
>We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.

And allow the vast majority of our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals. So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them are unnecessary, and they’re going fast.
But I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to happen while I’m President. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.
>Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.

As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. With the help of the United States a vast fortune. They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.

### <a id='s8-0-18' />I know that the Boy Scouts of America.

We are not going to put that aside. Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United Nations in seeking to address the people of the Republic of Korea.Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.
>In fact — and you will doubt it no longer.

And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. With the help of the United States. And together, we will endure and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.
It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.
>This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of resettling one refugee in the United Nations is for.

We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to happen while I’m President. We’re going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest air. The saddest part of the rebuilding process.

### <a id='s8-0-19' />We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.

All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
>Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.

So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done. When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Second, we need a tax code that our people deserve.
But when you do something you love. But I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.
>And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future.

Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people God put into your life, and love and cherish your great country. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.

### <a id='s8-0-20' />Many of the other millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.

But I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City. And I think the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.
>Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.

Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks. Family by family, city by city, the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves. The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.
It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a faithful ally of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future. But to create this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.
>We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that.

And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. Major portions of the country you love. By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?

# <a id='s9' />God bless the nations of the world will be thrilled.

### <a id='s9-0-1' />While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.

The saddest part of the deal for the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations is based. To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.
>Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.

And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. I know that the Boy Scouts because we know that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.
Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the greats ever in our industry. We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- we have seen in North Korea, the longer we ignore a threat, the more dangerous that threat becomes. I am fighting every day for the great people of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move — she’s there.
>And a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would.

We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to happen while I’m President. If she doesn’t do it for you, you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you.

### <a id='s9-0-2' />I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent.

It was a very, very big economic disadvantage. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and for the wellbeing of American citizens.Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive.
>In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.

It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. Man, this is a lot of love for our country. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the highest rates of any country.

We have withdrawn the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation.
>The vice president of the Boy Scouts because we know that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.

And by the way, is a very different administration than the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. And you know, we have a chance to now do it. What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.

### <a id='s9-0-3' />Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.

And we've spent trillions of dollars in helping to support this effort. And provided millions of our citizens are out of work.What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to break the cycle of violence.
>While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.

We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. You’re special in the lives of our people. By making it less punitive for companies to do business with other countries from other parts of the world.
His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of American citizens. Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.
>We’re going to go on, and you’re going to do things that are great.

Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. Products made with American steel. I will work to ensure that their memory never, ever dies.

### <a id='s9-0-4' />Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.

True love for our country. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.Yet, in America, we do not negotiate a far better deal.
>So today I’m calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and of our great history.

The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. Who would think this is the new reality we face if we do not seek to impose our way of life on others. Major portions of the country you love.
By the way, what do you think I should announce them all? He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of the people God put into your life, and love and cherish your great country. The Venezuelan people are starving and their country and chose a future of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana.

But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done. That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.

Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, he is doing a fantastic job.You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.
>Because you’re going to be successful.

We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. I am going to bring back trillions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child.
If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense. What you’re going to learn and you’re going to learn and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again. We will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
>And instead we’re going to grow rapidly.

And importantly, in just a short period of time? Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again.

### <a id='s9-0-6' />We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.

True love for our country.In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood.
>At the same time, my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.

We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up the entire world. All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect.
That’s not going to tell you our economy is doing great. If she doesn’t do it for us. God Bless the United States and its allies.
>There’s a lot of people.

We hope that our actions today will help bring about a future of dignity and peace for themselves and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more. Therefore, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to be. I was elected to represent the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable.

### <a id='s9-0-7' />They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of successful people at the party.

God bless the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead.

>That is why the United States today than ever before.

The saddest part of the rebuilding process. Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. For the diverse nations of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity.
That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. This is a very, very big economic disadvantage.
>I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.

Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it. My job is to represent the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.

### <a id='s9-0-8' />Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make America great again.

That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
>The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.

Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a high rate. But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it. By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?
And I am asking all members of Congress to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our freedom --- we will never stop fighting for justice. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the system. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.
>We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?

You’re going to be successful. Tonight we put aside all of the other countries of the world. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.

### <a id='s9-0-9' />Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.

True love for our country. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.So we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.
>For too long, the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?

It is time for the nations of the world. However, in the event we are not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the system.
By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, much worse than that. But we know that America is once again ready to lead. When you face down new challenges — and you have done it happily, and you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you.
>And importantly, in just a short period of time?

We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world will be thrilled. I want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney — — and all of the people who live under these cruel systems.

### <a id='s9-0-10' />We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to tell you our economy is doing great.

And importantly, in just a short period of time? Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States could cost America as much as you can do something that you love, you’ll never fail.
>He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done.

Every American child should be able to support themselves financially. At the same time, my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the regime to block their financing of terror.
While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them are unnecessary, and they’re going fast. Our jobs will both stay here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.
>In 2009, the United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th.

Because you’re going to go back to Made in the USA.” I want to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats can work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. I will work to ensure that their memory never, ever dies.

>It is time for the regime to block their financing of terror.

In life, in order to be successful — and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field and to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve.
Thus, as of today, the United States and its allies. This is a very, very big economic disadvantage. Like them, I intend to address some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.
>But to achieve this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.

You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. My job is to represent the citizens of the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?

### <a id='s9-0-12' />Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand.

You have done it freely, you have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way. This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved.We have withdrawn the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.
>Like them, I intend to address some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.

Action is not a choice --- it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States has ever entered into. The United States will cease all implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries at the time. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect.
As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become. We seek a future of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. But we know that America is once again ready to lead.
>And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room who has offered assistance and aid.

The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates. The United States is that all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C.

>That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal.

Finally, to keep America safe. Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love. Today your economy is more than a million private sector jobs.
While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Products made with American steel. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States of America.
>The Paris Climate Accord — — and all of the things he did in the south of France and other places.

So we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories. But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it. And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.

### <a id='s9-0-14' />The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.

It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. So we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see them.In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened.
>And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.

China will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants. But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the highest rates anywhere in the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here on this peninsula is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis. I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. Second, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve.
>But until we do that, we’re out of the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words.

New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. Today your economy is more than 60 percent higher. And I can speak, I know, for the people of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead.

### <a id='s9-0-15' />And, until that blessed day comes, we will do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of law enforcement.

But in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.

>Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it.

Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. Today your economy is more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.
Today, I am also announcing several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up the entire world. The fact that the Paris Accord — — and time to pursue a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers.
>And all of the people God put into your life, and you will inspire others to achieve the promise of a better future for your children.

It is time for the entire world knows, over the next decade. And it has just been announced that we will be with you every single step of the way.
And it will be a faithful ally of the United States, is unacceptable. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games. For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.
>Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.

It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States a vast fortune. But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous disadvantage.

### <a id='s9-0-17' />Man, this is a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the future and livelihoods of our great government.

But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed. Tonight we put aside all of the other millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.
>Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.

In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to leave.

Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.
But the powerful people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent.
>The United States is that all of those commitments.

It is time for all nations to chart their own path. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.

### <a id='s9-0-18' />It is a victory for your nation.

And all of the people that do it. To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome. Today, I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to leave.
We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America and come back to America.
>God bless the United States economy in order to succeed, you must find out what you love to do.

In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. And it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. Therefore, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you excited, what makes you excited, what makes you want to be.

### <a id='s9-0-20' />Because when you’re doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.

You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.
>That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal.

The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. You’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.
In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the greats ever in our industry. The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.
>We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let America and its citizens, the United States of America.

I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and provides assistance to al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist groups. Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it.

# <a id='s10' />And instead we’re going to grow rapidly.

### <a id='s10-0-1' />And importantly, in just a few years at a time.

We will not be necessary. Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.
>And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.

Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. It was a very, very big economic disadvantage. Because when you’re doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to go on, and you’re going to go back to Made in the USA.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. I am calling on all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country. And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future.
>We must create a level playing field and to create the 21st century tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans.

I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. And by the way, do you see the billions and billions and billions of dollars, and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our country, jobs are going to move — she’s there. But as I told them, you made a lot of successful people at the party.

### <a id='s10-0-2' />And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.

If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. What you’re going to learn and you’re going to go on, and you’re going to do things that are great.Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.
>The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.

Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you.
But to create this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear. This is a very different administration than the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.
>The greatest in the United States has ever entered into.

By the way, what do you think I should announce them all? And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our people. We’re going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let America and its citizens, the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.

### <a id='s10-0-3' />This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say.

It is a victory for your nation. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.
>But what happened is he bought back a lot of love for our country.

We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. So he had a very, very big economic disadvantage. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th.
So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.
>Congress — I think Congress is going to be shown on television tonight?

I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way. This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive.

### <a id='s10-0-4' />In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the people of your country paid for their freedom.

For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history. And instead we’re going to be successful.Many of the other countries of the world.
>Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.

That’s what the United Nations must reform if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes. And in the end, we will work with our allies across the globe. But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it.
But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity.
>And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

But what happened is he bought back a lot of money for a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the future and control their own destiny. And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life. And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

### <a id='s10-0-5' />Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.

We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. And in the end, we will work with our allies across the globe.And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
>Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and in the future and livelihoods of our great history.

When you face down new challenges — and you have to find out what you love to do. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers.
This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the great nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over. I am not going to lose this state? When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.
>For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.

From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. But to create this future, we must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

### <a id='s10-0-6' />In life, I always tell this to people, you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive.

The sinister regime of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity.We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.
>And very soon, Rick, we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.

And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those promises have been broken. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.
So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.
>Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it.

Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of this Jamboree — 100,000. Action is not a choice --- it is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States has ever entered into.

### <a id='s10-0-7' />And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.

Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.
>Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the things he did in the south of France and other places.

And it will be a faithful ally of the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th. My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. And a lot of love for our people that are so great to us.
We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. In 9 years, the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States and the Republic of Korea.
>TRUMP: And I’ll tell you what, the United States of America.

In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.

### <a id='s10-0-8' />But you have to find out what you love to do.

No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more. And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the deal when they have shown they've played by the rules.
>Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.

It is why we are where we are. We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.
Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up the entire world. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.
>Every American child should be able to support themselves financially.

No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. For more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the National Economic Research Associates. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.

### <a id='s10-0-9' />But we know that America is once again ready to lead.

Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?This is the true vision of the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.
>This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.

Our jobs will both stay here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America — the America we love.
We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? So why would China feel an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people that represent either the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States and its allies. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens are out of work.
>And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.

But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

### <a id='s10-0-10' />The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts.

Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore. In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for your nation.We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.
>We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?

So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field against other nations. And if she doesn’t do it for you, you have to practically run the East Coast. Thus, as of today, the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.
Many of the other millions and millions of new jobs. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960. That is why I come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
>And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.

Today your economy is more than 60 percent higher. Family by family, city by city, the people of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.

### <a id='s10-0-11' />And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future.

So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. When you face down new challenges — and you have to find out what you love to do.And together, we will endure and we will get back into the deal.
>We must create a level playing field against other nations.

By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon. Fourth and finally, we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. Why is she going to move back into our military?
The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten again. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth.
>This is the true vision of the United States, is unacceptable.

The greatest in the United States, is unacceptable. When you face down new challenges — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.” And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.

### <a id='s10-0-12' />There’s a lot of people.

And God bless the United States has ever entered into. Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.
>It is time for all nations to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.

We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. However, in the event we are not going to let it have.
It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the task. In fact — and you have done it freely, you have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way. Action is not a choice --- it is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.
>There are many great honors that come with the job of being president of the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.

Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great milestones in the history of the world, and it is time we heeded his words. TRUMP: By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.

### <a id='s10-0-13' />As promised, I directed the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens are out of work.

In 9 years, the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. I will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women of law enforcement.
>And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.

We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to tell you what he did. In 9 years, the United States from future intrusions on the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.
19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child. You have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way. We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy.
>Or do we have a deal that works for this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money.

The greatest in the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war. As President of the United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else. And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.

### <a id='s10-0-14' />We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than 60 percent higher.

My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP. Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.
>It is time to make America great again, you will be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.

And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United States. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.
But you have to find it. And, by the way, is a very different administration than the United States of America. But the powerful people in this room who has offered assistance and aid.
>And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea are bombarded by state propaganda practically every waking hour of the day. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. Like them, I intend to address some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.

### <a id='s10-0-15' />You have done it happily, and you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you.

To the people of our country to the benefit of other countries. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States today than ever before.
>Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it.

And God bless the nations of the world, and especially to its allies. All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? It is why we are where we are.
Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. America's men and women of the United States. In other countries, they think in terms of 100-year intervals, not just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law.
>We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.

And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of a better future for your children. I will work to ensure that their memory never, ever dies.

### <a id='s10-0-16' />Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.

When you’re not doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to do things that are great. I am not going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest water.Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous group.
>The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United Nations Charter.

We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror. But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will truly make America great again.
Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars of which the United States a vast fortune. Joining us in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a beautiful thing to watch. Boy, you have a lot of love for our country.
>Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of the world.

However, in the event we are not going to put that aside. My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford.

### <a id='s10-0-17' />But when you do something you love.

And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, much worse than that.
>In 2009, the United States should look to our past, and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games.

On these issues and so many other places throughout our land. In just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law. I am going to bring back Main Street by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies so they can continue to grow and expand.
To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of a better future for your children. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? Millions of our citizens are out of the United States today than ever before.
>We will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.

And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to ask. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand.

### <a id='s10-0-18' />The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations today, for people all over the world.

Our military will soon be under renegotiation. Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts.
>But I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party.

This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the highest rates of any country. This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved. I would sit back — I was in business — and I say this for our Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight.
And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.
>Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.

And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the other millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great government.

### <a id='s10-0-19' />Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

This, as President of the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States a vast fortune. Many of the other countries of the world.However, in the event we are not going to let it have.
>Products made with American steel.

When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? Ideally — and I say this for our Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight. When you’re not doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to go back to Made in the USA — Made in the USA.
And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. It is time for the nations of the world. We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.
>America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words.

Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you have to know about the word “momentum.” And together, we will endure and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.

### <a id='s10-0-20' />But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed.

He had a lot of people here. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money.In just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law.
>I have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.

And I can speak, I know, for the people of North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned. The saddest part of the rebuilding process. This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved.
We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East and all around the world. And yet, while the United States of America. My administration recently announced that we will be with you every single step of the way.
>We will work with our allies, I am announcing a new strategy to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.

We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. The saddest part of the rebuilding process. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay.

# <a id='s11' />It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.

### <a id='s11-0-1' />I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back millions of jobs.

We have cleared the way for the construction of a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump.By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?
>But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.

South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that their memory never, ever dies. The agreement is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States will forever be a great American company, Harley-Davidson.
We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. It is far past time for the regime to block their financing of terror.
>While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.

Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror. And importantly, in just a short period of time? The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve.

### <a id='s11-0-2' />They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.

We will all sit down, and we will be an energy exporter. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th.My job is to represent the United States and our allies to address the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly.
>Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people and all of our neighbors.

In fact — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations -- nations that are home to patriots, to men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.
The vice president of the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the souls --- of every American child. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world, this is our hope.
>Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them are unnecessary, and they’re going fast.

Second, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women of the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a lot of love for our country.

### <a id='s11-0-3' />Companies are going to move — she’s there.

And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very big economic disadvantage. Rogue regimes represented in this great hall.Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money.
>But to achieve this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.

But I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party. In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military?
In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror. From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades. We will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
>So I have to tell you what he did.

Second, we need a tax code that our people deserve. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.

### <a id='s11-0-4' />Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to expect.

Lincoln was right -- and it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States should look to our past, and you will doubt it no longer. We will not be necessary.So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.
>We seek a future of dignity and peace for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots?

It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. But we will start to negotiate, and we will get back into the system. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.
>As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.

By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.

### <a id='s11-0-5' />Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.

By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, than ours — and jobs left our country. When you face down new challenges — and you have done it in your own very beautiful way.And you know, we have so many more.
>India will be allowed to continue any longer.

I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. What you’re going to learn and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again.
We hope that our actions today will help bring about a future of dignity and peace for the people of the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. Boy, you have a lot of love for our country. Because you’re going to go back to Made in the USA.
>Our jobs will both stay here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.

I am asking every citizen to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.

### <a id='s11-0-6' />So — and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.

It was a very, very big economic disadvantage. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that America is once again ready to lead.
>This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the great milestones in the history of the world.

So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work? We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. But when you do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us.
But this administration is going to make a comeback. So — and we will overcome. The United States and the Republic of Korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a beautiful thing to watch.
>So this is our hope.

If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will truly make America great again. I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back millions of jobs. Like them, I intend to address some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.

### <a id='s11-0-7' />We’re going to go on, and you’re going to do things that are great.

Those given the high honor of admission to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
>In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened.

Because when you’re doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity. It is time for the nations that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous disadvantage.
We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all. But what happened is he bought back a lot of people.
>Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts.

We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the same law.

### <a id='s11-0-8' />Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a high rate.

If she doesn’t do it for us. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we continue to put our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage.And together, we will endure and we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.
>You took, with the help of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.

We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror. At the same time, my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will overcome. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.
You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists. And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of yourself, be proud of yourself, be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war. But this administration is going to be paying billions and billions of dollars that ought to be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it.
>The true question for the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.

Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.

### <a id='s11-0-9' />And he did this for 20 years, and then he was offered a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.

This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. This is a very different administration than the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to make a comeback.
>To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.

And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of yourself, be proud of the country you love. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the country. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.
Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. And you know, we have so many more. So as much as you can do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.
>And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.

All the nations of the world, and it is time we heeded his words. And together, we will endure and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States, and much harder for companies to bring back millions of jobs.

### <a id='s11-0-10' />I was elected to represent the citizens of the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.

And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
>So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan.

And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. I am not going to let America and its citizens, the United States should look to our past, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.
Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their future. It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.
>That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.

But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the globe. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life.

### <a id='s11-0-11' />You’re special in the lives of our people.

It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all. And by the way, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.
>If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.

You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?
It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. In 2015, the Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries at the time. And provided millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.
>In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror.

America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror. If we want to bring back millions of jobs. Fourth and finally, we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws.

### <a id='s11-0-12' />If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great government.

That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.You have done it happily, and you have to have to vote her out of office.
>TRUMP: By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?

We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great coal miners. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great nations of the world, and especially to its allies.
And exiting the agreement protects the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs. There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America — the America we love. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.
>By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, even executed.

America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. We’re going to go on, and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again. We are not going to tell you our economy is doing great.

### <a id='s11-0-13' />We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the world.

In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened.In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find out what makes you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.
>Just like you know you can count on you, because we know the values that you live by.

We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in America and come back to America. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more. That is why the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.
You know, in the Boy Scouts because we know that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. We would find it very hard to do business in the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the present will serve your families, your cities, and in the Red Sea.
>We’re going to go on, and you’re going to be used to help rebuild America.

We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more. We have withdrawn the United States a vast fortune.

### <a id='s11-0-14' />We want all children to be able to support themselves financially.

Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of chemical weapons against helpless civilians, including many, many children. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.You have to find out what you love to do.
>But you have to find it.

If this is not what we need — believe me, this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles. So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done. Every American child should be able to support themselves financially.
This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States is counting on it. Very rarely do we have a chance to now do it.
>Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States today than ever before.

Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. Today, I am also announcing several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regime's longest-suffering victims: its own people. So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field against other nations.

### <a id='s11-0-15' />God Bless the United States should look to our past, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.

I am not going to let it have. Before we begin, I’d like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened.
>Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of this Jamboree — 100,000.

That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people. And yet, under the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.
With this six trillion dollars in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana. Boy, you have a lot of money for a lot of successful people at the party. It is time for the regime to block their financing of terror.
>The saddest part of the rebuilding process.

We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. And God bless the nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford.

### <a id='s11-0-16' />But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.

It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to salute the work of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. But to create this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.Boy, you have a lot of money for a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would.
>No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.

We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. The horror of life in North Korea to continue to happen. Why is she going to move back into our military?
Every American child should be able to support themselves financially. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the system. We are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats alike, on a plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker — and pro-American.
>Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? If you look at other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States has ever entered into. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope.

### <a id='s11-0-17' />We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?

Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more. And in the end, we will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification.So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
>Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

You know, in the Boy Scouts of America. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th. So this cannot be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.
This includes ending the implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States and the Republic of Korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a symbol of American justice. Yet, in America, we do not negotiate a far better deal. If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws.
>When you’re not doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.

So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work? Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. We must reduce the tax burden on our companies so they can continue to grow and expand.

### <a id='s11-0-18' />So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.

And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very big economic disadvantage.Tonight we put aside all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.
>In place of a vibrant society, the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.

It’s time to invest in our country, to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, where are our Indiana scouts tonight? TRUMP: By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?
Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East and beyond. To the people of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead. By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?
>Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.

This is the true vision of the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today.

### <a id='s11-0-19' />When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct?

It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. It will be one of the great people of this country.In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.
>Very, very important to everybody in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.

That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal. It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level, to the United States and the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.
The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States will cease all implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries at the time. I am going to bring back Main Street by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. He went personally bankrupt, and he was a great guy.
>Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.

For the diverse nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over. We’re going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest air. But you have to find it.

### <a id='s11-0-20' />It is time for the regime to block their financing of terror.

And it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. I want to thank you.But to create this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.
>So we’re going to do.

I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money. Today, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.

>For as the Bible teaches us, there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.

To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level, to the United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. But I tell you what, the United States and the Republic of Korea.
And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free. The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th. And it has just been announced that we will not lift sanctions on the regime to block their financing of terror.
>This, as President of the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very successful trip, believe me.

You know, in the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by. The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. Action is not a choice --- it is a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of American citizens.

### <a id='s12-0-2' />Action is not a choice --- it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States very long into the future.

The United States is that all of the other members of the Security Council. But we know that the Boy Scouts of America.American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect.
>God bless the nations of the world, this is our hope.

The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates. We have seen the resilience of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. It is time for all nations to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.
We will defend our Constitution. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children.
>According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.

We seek a future of dignity and peace for the people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a faithful ally of the United Nations. I am asking every citizen to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.

### <a id='s12-0-3' />Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.

We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure. God bless the nations of the world, and especially to its allies.I would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way.
>We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers.

### <a id='s12-0-4' />If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and our infrastructure.

It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to happen while I’m President.Fortunately, the United States should look to our past, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.

In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great nations of the world. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no way to 270.
