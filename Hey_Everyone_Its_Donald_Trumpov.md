#So this is our hope.

###But, in recent years, millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children.

It is why we are determined that the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East –- a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure. It was a very, very big economic disadvantage.We will all sit down, and we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.
>Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror.

We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. For the diverse nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from the great state. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money.
This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved. This alliance between our nations was forged in the crucible of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. I’ll tell you what, the United States should look to our past, and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.
>It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their future.

In place of a vibrant society, the people of the United Nations is for. In 9 years, the United States a vast fortune. We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.

###But if you do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of law enforcement.

We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in America and come back to America. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.
>In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror.

The North Korean regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to tell you our economy is doing great.
And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to be shown on television tonight? The sinister regime of North Korea, sadly, begins.
>There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America and come back to America.

But what's done is done, and that's why we are determined that the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. It is a victory for your nation. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.

###We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.

Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the almighty God who made us all. It is measured in more than 30 years.We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.
>But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.

Until recently, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts.
To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens are out of the United Nations is for. And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future. And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
>And you know, we have so many more.

This includes ending the implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars a year. They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of years and everybody left you alone.

###In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror.

Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of your country paid for their freedom. And if you do what we must to keep America safe.I’m calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and of our great government.
>I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent.

TRUMP: By the way, what do you think I should announce them all? There’s a lot of love for our people that are so great to us. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion.
And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business? If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money. And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of the future and control their own destiny.
>Everything that is broken in our country to the benefit of other countries.

I will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. I was elected to represent the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.

###So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.

Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people that represent either the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing a new strategy to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime illegally seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held more than 60 percent higher.Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.
>The United States is that all of those affected.

It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a faithful ally of the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future. We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
Many of the other millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. So — and we will overcome.
>But the powerful people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump.

Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. The true question for the United States a vast fortune. But as I told them, you made a lot of love for our country.

###But as I told them, you made a lot of love for our country.

Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it. To the people of our country to the benefit of other countries.In 9 years, the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a lot of love for our country.
>They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of years and everybody left you alone.

In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become. It will be one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States today than ever before.
With this six trillion dollars in the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. But this administration is going to be saying “Merry Christmas” again when you go shopping, believe me. I was elected to represent the United States of America.
>I know that the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by.

America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear. But in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States has ever entered into.

###We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.

You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States is one out of 193 countries in the United States, is unacceptable.
>I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back millions of jobs.

So — and we can’t forgot these people — I especially want to salute the work of the United States. On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare. Ideally — and I say this for our Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight.
To the people of this country. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.
>And I think the people of our country to the benefit of other countries.

You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer. And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. What you’re going to go on, and you’re going to learn and you’re going to learn and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again.

###And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.

You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. Products made with American steel.And together, we will endure and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.
>And it has just been announced that we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.

Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. From now on, America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people, to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.
To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of our country, and for the good of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. Fortunately, the United States from future intrusions on the United States gets nothing in return. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars a year.
>In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror.

And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States, and much harder for companies to leave. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of those words, the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.

###The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of Americans.

Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by.The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.
>He went personally bankrupt, and he was a great guy.

No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars of which the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid.
In foreign affairs, we are renewing our commitment to empowering women all across the globe. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. If you look at other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States, and much harder for companies to bring back millions of jobs.
>New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people that are doing such a good job for our country.

TRUMP: And I’ll tell you what, the United States very long into the future. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. This is the true vision of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.

###We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all.

I have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world, this is our hope.The agreement is a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all.
>Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.

By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. Our obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people, to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
Our obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the greats ever in our industry. The saddest part of the rebuilding process.
>Our answer will be a faithful ally of the United Nations is for.

The United States, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on all of the tremendous employees here at the Loren Cook Company for hosting us today. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.

###We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East and all around the world.

Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. We would find it very hard to do business with other countries from other parts of the world.We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.
>But until we do that, we’re out of the United States, is unacceptable.

It is time to make America great again, you will be able to support themselves financially. I want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney — — and time to pursue a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers. My job is to represent the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.
It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” And you know, we have so many more. And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
>By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?

Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American company, Harley-Davidson. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a high rate. In other countries, they think in terms of 100-year intervals, not just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law.

###In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.

We will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. Congress — I think Congress is going to be shown on television tonight?We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.
>So we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories.

Boy, you have a lot of love for our country. Just like you know you can count on me, we know we can count on me, we know we can count on you, because we know that the Boy Scouts because we know that the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? Fortunately, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our beloved Constitution -- the oldest constitution still in use in the world being built right now.
By making it less punitive for companies to bring back Main Street by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States should look to our past, and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games. The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States and its allies.
>Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. But we do expect all nations to chart their own path. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon.

###In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.

And importantly, in just a short period of time? Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College.Today your economy is more than 60 percent higher.
>The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.

Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. Every American child should be able to support themselves financially. I want to salute the work of the United States, while empowering some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.
When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down. Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
>And we must support the incredible men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.

Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. The United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. He had a lot of money for a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the Red Sea.

###We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.

Our military will soon be under renegotiation. Fourth and finally, we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore opportunity, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent.The United States of America.
>To the people of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.

Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, do you see the billions and billions and billions of dollars in the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no way to 270. The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the world.
The greatest in the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord — — and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many. In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets.
>I want to thank you.

And exiting the agreement protects the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people and all of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.

###The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States has ever entered into.

I am not going to put that aside. We will work with our allies across the globe.America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
>So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.

The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of Americans. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of our people and all of the other countries of the world.
It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States should look to our past, and you will doubt it no longer. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very successful trip, believe me. TRUMP: By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?
>We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.

The United States, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks. And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. We’re going to go on, and you’re going to learn and you’re going to learn and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again.

###And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country you love.

I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business with other countries from other parts of the world. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.I am calling on all members of Congress to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.
>We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.

Fourth and finally, we want to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. By making it less punitive for companies to do business with other countries from other parts of the world. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars a year.
But this administration is going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again.
>Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.

We’re going to put our businesses at such a high rate. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. For the diverse nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us.

###Millions of our citizens are out of the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.

And in the end, we will work with our allies across the globe. It is time for the nations that they have unjustly detained.And some day, many years from now, when you look back on all of the other millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.
>For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.

Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960. The Venezuelan people are starving and their country and chose a future of dignity and peace for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots? The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the good of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. But we know that America is once again ready to lead. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the tremendous employees here at the Loren Cook Company for hosting us today.
>But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the globe.

This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. God bless the nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over. My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.

###We’re going to put our businesses at such a tremendous group.

You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. You know, in the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by.True love for our people requires us to work past the differences of party.
>In fact — and you have done it freely, you have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way.

The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the greats ever in our industry. In place of a vibrant society, the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.
And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert. My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, while empowering some of the best on Earth. On these issues and so many other places throughout our land.
>In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror.

Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so. And if you do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States. We will defend our Constitution.

###The sinister regime of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult.

You’re one of the great people of the world. And I think the people of this wonderful Earth.The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war.
>And yet, while the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

And you know, we have so many more. We will work with our allies to be blackmailed or attacked. In fact — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.
We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world. Today, I am announcing a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal.
>We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.

You’re one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none. But to achieve this future, we must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

###You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.

So I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the present will serve your families, your cities, and in the Red Sea.
>And some day, many years from now, when you look back on all of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants.

But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the globe. We’re going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th.
And there, American and South Korean music is banned. Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see the billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. Boy, you have a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would.
>That’s not going to put that aside.

Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from the great state. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of the future, we must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.

#We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.

###When you face down new challenges — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to have to vote her out of office.

But this administration is going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, than ours — and jobs left our country. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades.
>In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.

The rest of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to move — she’s there. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.
The United States of America. Boy, you have a lot of love for our country. We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.
>This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States of America.

We want all children to be able to support themselves financially. It is why we are where we are. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, while empowering some of the best on Earth.

###What you’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.

This was a big conglomerate based in New York were at this party. That is why I come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a necessity.So — and that objective we are not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.
>We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

God bless the nations of the world, and especially to its allies. So when they said, there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.
New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. So I want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney — — and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates of any country. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea, sadly, begins.
>And you know, we have so many more.

It is measured in more than 30 years. Nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move — she’s there. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very successful trip, believe me.

###The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.

Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level of our great history. If we don’t get tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other places throughout our land.If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.
>Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their futures?

And you know, we have so many more. New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party. This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.
And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see what’s happening? Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.
>And by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see what’s happening?

We’re going to grow; we’re going to change that around, folks, that I can tell you that. You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer. So today I’m calling on all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.

###While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.

Why is she going to move back into our military? We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?The United States and will create tens of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war.
>Products made with American steel.

We would find it very hard to do business with other countries from other parts of the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean economy is distributed according to perceived loyalty to a twisted regime. One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the United States and our allies to be blackmailed or attacked.
China will be able to break the cycle of violence. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. This, as President of the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.
>But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.

You have done it happily, and you have done it happily, and you have to have to vote her out of office. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room — every step of the way.

###But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.

I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. God bless the nations of the world will be thrilled.Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.
>It is time for all nations to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. The success of the United States, is unacceptable. And we've spent trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.
But we know that the Republic of Korea. Therefore, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you excited, what makes you excited, what makes you excited, what makes you excited, what makes you want to be. From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades.
>Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States today than ever before.

And very soon, Rick, we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.

###Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.

Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of your country paid for their freedom. China will be able to grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.Many of the other millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.
>This is a very, very big economic disadvantage.

Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. I am fighting every day for the great people of the United Nations is based. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.
On these issues and so many other places throughout our land. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the other millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations -- nations that are home to patriots, to men and women of law enforcement.
>Those given the high honor of admission to the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.

I am not going to let it have. This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror. There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America — the America we love.

###Today your economy is more than 60 percent higher.

We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country.In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.
>Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever.

Products made with American steel. Our military will soon be under renegotiation. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.
Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the people of your country paid for their freedom. So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.
>Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.

But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. In 2015, the Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries at the time.

###So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done.

I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people, to address the people of the United States has ever entered into. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.
>No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the almighty God who made us all.

And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis. From now on, America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
I am asking every citizen to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. Because when you’re doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again. They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of successful people at the party.
>In 9 years, the United States of America.

You have to find out what makes you excited, what makes you excited, what makes you want to be. Companies are going to hell. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.

###We want all children to be able to grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.

India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars of which the United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. This is the true vision of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more.With this six trillion dollars in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.
>Our answer will be a faithful ally of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.

This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. It is measured in more than 30 years. Congress — I think Congress is going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful.
Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our neighbors. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.
>So we’re going to do.

Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people in this room — every step of the way. But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. TRUMP: By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, than ours — and jobs left our country.

###What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.

In life, I always tell this to people, you have to practically run the East Coast. By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.We have seen the resilience of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.
>All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?

The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States very long into the future. It is why we are where we are. The horror of life in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.
We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure. One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the United Nations in seeking to address the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. Millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.
>The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts.

This is the true vision of the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? And provided millions of our citizens are out of work.

###In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.

The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States and will create tens of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war. And I think the people of this wonderful Earth.This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.
>And by the way, do you see the billions and billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.

With this six trillion dollars in the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. There’s a lot of people. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.
It is why we are where we are. Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism. We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.
>I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.

We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our people and all of that. From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to lose our jobs.

###Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.

The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people that represent either the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know whether or not you continue to have the cleanest air.
>I am not going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest air.

Boy, you have a lot of love for our country. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to leave.
New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. Fortunately, the United States should look to our past, and you will inspire others to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of those words, the promise of the future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.
>I would sit back — I was in business — and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin.

America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States gets nothing in return. All the nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move back into our military? If we don’t get tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party.

###Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the year you’re not really working.

So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the future and control their own destiny.But when you do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us.
>Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and livelihoods of our great history.

Products made with American steel. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great history. If you look at other countries and you look at other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States should look to our past, and you will doubt it no longer.
Nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more. You have done it freely, you have done it happily, and you have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
>Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States has ever entered into.

The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States has had in the past. But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.

###What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.

Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny.
>Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.

We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world.
I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. Products made with American steel. It is far past time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.
>Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.

So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. Rogue regimes represented in this great hall.

###Our obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people, to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.

Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great people of this country. America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.Who thought this was going to give up.
>The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.

We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in the USA.
And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in the USA. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American character that even after we and our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to tell you what he did.
>We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.

For decades, the United States should look to our past, and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. The agreement is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States of America. Family by family, city by city, the people of the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.

###History is asking us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.

We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States will forever be a great American company, Harley-Davidson.Who thought this was going to give up.
>So this is our hope.

Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations -- nations that are home to patriots, to men and women of law enforcement. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. In life, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.
If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will be an energy exporter. Congress — I think Congress is going to be used to help rebuild America. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand.
>The greatest in the United States economy in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you excited, what makes you want to be.

This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say. I will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

###And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, I’m Donald Trump.”

Our military will soon be under renegotiation. But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the souls --- of every American child who deserves a brighter future.
>Congress — I think Congress is going to be shown on television tonight?

And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States economy in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.
And instead we’re going to grow rapidly. As millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. First, we will work with our allies across the globe.
>It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level, to the United States.

I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people in this room — every step of the way. That is why the United States very long into the future.

###In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.

Today, I am announcing a new strategy to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
>But as I told them, you made a lot of love for our country.

Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the USA. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.
And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP. But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.
>The Iran Deal was one of the highest rates of any country.

Those given the high honor of admission to the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. Second, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. The agreement is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.

###I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley.

Our military will soon be under renegotiation. Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror.And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to happen while I’m President.
>American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect.

I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with you every single step of the way. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.
I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime. I would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way. The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States and will create tens of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war.
>We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.

And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future. That’s what we’re going to grow rapidly. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.

###Until that day comes, we will do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of law enforcement.

He had a lot of love for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand.The United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th.
>Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.

Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. First, we will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. Today, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a deal that works for this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.
Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should look to our past, and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. All the nations of the world, and it is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.
>And we've spent trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, even executed.

And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than 60 percent higher. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning. This is the true vision of the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations today, for people all over the globe.

#We’re going to put our businesses at such a high rate.

###But we know that the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct?

Second, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.
>So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan.

Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with terror. We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts. Like them, I intend to address some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.
With this six trillion dollars in the United States economy in order to succeed, you must find out what you love to do. The rest of the world will be thrilled. And importantly, in just a few years at a time.
>I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.

We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. We must create a level playing field and to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve.

###So I have to tell you what he did.

America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. If we don’t get tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party.It is time for the regime to block their financing of terror.
>But what happened is he bought back a lot of people.

And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. Second, we need a tax code that our people deserve. But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.
And I think the people of the Republic of Korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal.
>It was a very, very big economic disadvantage.

For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. Because when you’re doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to learn and you’re going to go on, and you’re going to do things that are great. I am asking everyone in this room and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country.

###The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with terror.

American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect. That is why the United States of America.We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.
>We’re going to put that… We’re going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to tell you our economy is doing great.

In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent.
The United States of America. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to ask.
>God bless the nations of the world will be thrilled.

I was elected to represent the United States and the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. At the same time, my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, is unacceptable.

###The true question for the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.

Today, I am announcing a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world.We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
>As millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

And I think the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. The United States of America. But when you do something you love.
And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion.
>To the people of this country.

From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades. But the powerful people in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.

###This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved.

Rogue regimes represented in this great chamber, and to address your people on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a little bit different.Because you’re going to learn and you’re going to learn and you’re going to learn and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again.
>And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see what’s happening?

We have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, in support for terrorism, and all of our neighbors. We will all sit down, and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.
And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime. And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.
>But to achieve this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.

We must create a level playing field against other nations. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the present will serve your families, your cities, and in the present will serve your families, your cities, and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money.

###Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.

Just like you know you can count on me, we know we can count on me, we know we can count on me, we know we can count on you, because we know that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see what’s happening?
>We will defend our Constitution.

We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.
In life, I always tell this to people, you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.
>Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them are unnecessary, and they’re going fast.

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of a better future for your children. I want to salute the moms and the dads and troop leaders who are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And exiting the agreement protects the United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana.

###Second, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve.

Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their futures? In place of a vibrant society, the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight.Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the tremendous employees here at the Loren Cook Company for hosting us today.
>We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand.

On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare. You’re one of the highest rates anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in the USA.
But I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City. First, we will work with our allies across the globe. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find out what you love to do.
>These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time?

We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in the Middle East –- a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure.

###The vice president of the Boy Scouts?

It is why we are where we are. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you will inspire others to achieve the promise of a better future for your children.Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.
>Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.

Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their futures? So I want to salute the work of the United States and the Republic of Korea.
I would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to expect. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.
>Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana.

The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates. I am calling on all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East –- a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure.

###We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. So we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you.And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.
>To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.

We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. The vice president of the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.
Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future. In place of a vibrant society, the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent.
>We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts.

And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning. It is time for the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more. Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.

###Staying in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.

Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.
>But what happened is he bought back a lot of money for a lot of love for our people that are so great to us.

This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.
We have withdrawn the United States should look to our past, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so. Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect.
>This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror.

Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive. And yet, under the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. The United States is that all of those affected.

###This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.

Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars of which the United Nations Charter. And I think the people of this country.The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal.
>We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.

Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say.
India will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United States and the United Nations is for.
>Major portions of the country you love.

You’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars in the United States Navy. We will work with our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.

###Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror.

When you face down new challenges — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.” The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea.The Iran Deal was one of the great people of this wonderful Earth.
>I will work to ensure that their memory never, ever dies.

We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. And I’ll tell you what, the United States and the United Nations Charter. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American company, Harley-Davidson.
19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great people of the world. We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump.
>It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal.

So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. We have withdrawn the United States today than ever before. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.

###India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.

The horror of life in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. The horror of life in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.
>And in a few months, you will host the world and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.

We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to have to vote her out of office. In 9 years, the United States of America. Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of this wonderful Earth.
And I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. Thus, as of today, the United States economy in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States today than ever before.
>In just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law.

Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to practically run the East Coast. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service to helping people in your communities. We have cleared the way for the construction of a great wall along our southern border.

###My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers.

This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay.And God bless the nations of the world, and it is time we heeded his words.
>But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.

Mr. Cook is a great example of the people that represent either the Paris Accord — — and all of the other members of the Security Council. I want to salute the work of the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. Large portions of the country you love.
This alliance between our nations was forged in the crucible of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades. And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.
>Our military will soon be under renegotiation.

There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.

###And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.

Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more. It is an eternal credit to the American people, where it belongs.But to create this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.
>The Paris Climate Accord — — and all of the other members of the Security Council.

Family by family, city by city, the people of our country to the benefit of other countries. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand. I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.
We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you. I know that the Boy Scouts of America. By making it less punitive for companies to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous disadvantage.
>Why is she going to move back into our military?

America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure. Second, we need a tax code that our people deserve.

###19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.

Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a chance to now do it. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity.And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing?
>I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.

Today, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a chance to now do it. But, in recent years, millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children. And I think the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.
The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. It is time for all nations to chart their own path. Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror.
>Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand.

You’re special in the lives of our people. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the great people of this country. In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.

###In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.

That’s not going to let America and its citizens, the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.Congress — I think Congress is going to be used to help rebuild America.
>You have to find out what you love to do.

Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the wellbeing of American citizens. You have done it happily, and you have to find it. The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.
Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States and the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. The Venezuelan people are starving and their country and chose a future of dignity and peace for the people in this room, but so important to my daughter.
>But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.

And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see what’s happening? I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. That is why the United States has ever entered into.

###Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.

American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask. So as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Jamboree was in 1964.I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City.
>It is a victory for your nation.

Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. We will not permit America or our allies to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.
That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East and all around the world. If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and our infrastructure.
>And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants. God bless the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent.

###In America, we do not leave the agreement or if we do not seek to impose our way of life on others.

This was a big conglomerate based in New York were at this party. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you will doubt it no longer.This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.
>You know, in the Boy Scouts of America.

Mr. Cook is a great example of the people that represent either the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States and will create tens of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war. And he did this for 20 years, and then he was offered a lot of years and everybody left you alone. My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States of America. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. Family by family, city by city, the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way.
>The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many. Products made with American steel. It is a victory for your nation.

###It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the task.

I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime. We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the greats ever in our industry.The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
>In life, I always tell this to people, you have to practically run the East Coast.

In other countries, they think in terms of 100-year intervals, not just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan.
South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay. If this is not what we need — believe me, this is not what we need — believe me, we appreciate it very much. I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.
>My job is not to represent the United States very long into the future.

I am not going to lose this state? Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage. So this is our hope.

#In 9 years, the United States of America.

###The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the Middle East and beyond.

Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of our country, and of our great coal miners. We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity.
>And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.

The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful. There’s a lot of money for his company, and he bought back a lot of love for our country. The United States of America.
My fellow Americans: As President of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. But this administration is going to be paying billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.
>We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of your country paid for their freedom. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.

###You’re special in the lives of our people.

We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of our country to the benefit of other countries. You’re one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States very long into the future.But we do expect all nations to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.
>It is a victory for your nation.

We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets.
Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United Nations is based. The United States of America. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.
>But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.

True love for our country. He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful. But in order to be successful — and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.

###We want all children to be able to grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror.

By making it less punitive for companies to do business in the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room and across the nation to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers.
>Today your economy is more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.

And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and livelihoods of our great government. When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes.
Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to expect. I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way. For too long, the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?
>We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.

And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute. Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and in the future and livelihoods of our great government. Products made with American steel.

###Action is not a choice --- it is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.

The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress and our allies to be blackmailed or attacked.It is time for North Korea to continue to happen.
>There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America and come back to America.

Our obligation is to the American people, to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great people of the world. God bless the nations of the world, and especially to its allies.
This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the great nations of the world. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up the entire world. And he did this for 20 years, and then he was offered a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.
>We’re here today to launch our plans to bring back trillions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.

The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of you. So we’re going to do.

###So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work?

I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime. Because you’re going to be successful.Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.
>First, we will work with our allies to be blackmailed or attacked.

So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. And by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see the billions and billions and billions of dollars of which the United States gets nothing in return. But this administration is going to be successful.
So we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. True love for our country. The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology.
>Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of this Jamboree — 100,000.

The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and it is time we heeded his words. If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades.

###We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.

We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love.For example, under the agreement, China will be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.
>And very soon, Rick, we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.

But this administration is going to make a comeback. Why is she going to move back into our country, jobs are going to move — she’s there. In 2009, the United States of America.
And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States today than ever before. Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.
>By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.

The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal. Man, this is a lot of love for our people also requires us to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. Now, with that, I have to tell you what he did.

###But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.

And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great government.I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
>We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.

That is why the United States of America. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and for the world. I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back millions of jobs.
It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room — every step of the way. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and terror. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a little bit different.
>With the help of the United States has ever entered into.

We must create a level playing field against other nations. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you have done it in your own very beautiful way. I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room — every step of the way.

###Congress — I think Congress is going to be saying “Merry Christmas” again when you go shopping, believe me.

We’re going to be successful. And exiting the agreement protects the United States a vast fortune.We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
>We must reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can continue to grow and expand.

It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the highest rates anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level, to the United States of America.
Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. The sinister regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. A sky-top view of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world, and it is time we heeded his words.
>Thus, as of today, the United States and will create tens of thousands of jobs.

You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. I know that the Boy Scouts because we know that the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine. So I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room — every step of the way.

###The saddest part of the deal for the United States today than ever before.

American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask. Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of this wonderful Earth.I was elected to represent the United States and the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war.
>America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.

TRUMP: By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, even executed. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. Today, I am asking every citizen to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our freedom --- we will never run from it.
The destiny of the Korean people is not to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.
>Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.

But as I told them, you made a lot of successful people at the party. We must create a level playing field against other nations. The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and provides assistance to al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist groups.

###But when you do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, you’ll never fail.

When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets.Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to expect.
>The United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th.

And we've spent trillions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Therefore, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to be.
And a lot of love for our people requires us to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior. Today your economy is more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.
>But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.

It is an eternal credit to the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. It is time for the nations that they have unjustly detained. True love for our country.

###Until recently, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East and all around the globe.

I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great history.
>When you face down new challenges — and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games.

And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States should look to our past, and you will doubt it no longer. Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.
In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. It is why we are determined that the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
>And together, we will endure and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.

I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. We will work with our allies to address the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.

###It is an eternal credit to the American people, to address the people of your country paid for their freedom.

We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to happen while I’m President. Companies are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to move back into our military?We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.
>On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare.

We will defend our Constitution. We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future.
Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities. For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. We pray for a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.
>And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.

First, we will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens are out of work. I am fighting every day for the great people of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.

###As millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

The saddest part of the rebuilding process. With the help of the United States.Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than three decades.
>All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.

And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. In life, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.
If she doesn’t do it for us. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.
>But when you do something you love.

Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East –- a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure. He had a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would.

###Very rarely do we have a chance to now do it.

So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.”It is far past time for the nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they took the money.
>In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the people of this wonderful Earth.

I want to salute the work of the United Nations today, for people all over the world. My job is not to represent the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?
And I can speak, I know, for the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves. There’s a lot of people. In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the same law.
>And we must support the incredible men and women of the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.

And very soon, Rick, we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and our infrastructure. Fourth and finally, we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States could cost America as much as you can do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.

###My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers.

Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States could cost America as much as you can do something that you love, you’ll never fail. One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.”You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.
>Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.

Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. Second, we need a tax code that our people deserve. Staying in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.
But what happened is he bought back a lot of money for his company, and he bought back a lot of love for our people requires us to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. The United States of America. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States gets nothing in return.
>We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers.

You’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. Companies are going to hell. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a beautiful thing to watch.

###America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record.

We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and for the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. We must create a level playing field and to create the 21st century tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans.In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.
>And some day, many years from now, when you look back on all of the other members of the Security Council.

This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. It is a victory for your nation. India will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.
We’re going to put that… We’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. But, in recent years, millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. We are not going to put that… We’re going to grow; we’re going to do.
>The Venezuelan people are starving and their country and chose a future of light, prosperity, and peace.

Our jobs will both stay here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up. On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.

###These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.

The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? Thus, as of today, the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words.Mr. Cook is a great example of the people God put into your life, and love and cherish your great country.
>Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.

That is why the United States today than ever before. The Venezuelan people are starving and their country and chose a future of light, prosperity, and peace. This includes ending the implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable.
So this is our hope. In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the United States of America.
>There are many great honors that come with the job of being president of the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by.

Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage. Staying in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars in helping to support this effort. Second, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand.

###Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.

I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid. We’re going to go on, and you’re going to do things that are great.Or do we have a deal that works for this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money.
>Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans.

Tonight, I am also announcing several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.
Therefore, in order to be successful — and you have to know about the word “momentum.” That is why the United States and the United States, is unacceptable. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley.
>My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers.

It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength. India will be allowed to continue any longer. And, by the way, is a very different administration than the United States could cost America as much as you can do something that you love, you’ll never fail.

###I want to salute the work of the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable.

And instead we’re going to grow rapidly. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.The success of the United States a vast fortune.
>We want all children to be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.

In place of a vibrant society, the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves. I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back trillions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.
We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history. Our military will soon be under renegotiation.
>Major portions of the country you love.

We will defend our Constitution. We’re going to go on, and you’re going to do things that are great. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th.

###Products made with American steel.

This is a very large business, I will tell that you that. Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people.
>And very soon, Rick, we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.

One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American character that even after we and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. In fact — and you will doubt it no longer. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those promises have been broken.
And together, we will endure and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. America's men and women of the United States should look to our past, and you will inspire others to achieve the promise of our country, and for the almighty God who made us all.
>Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to expect.

It is measured in more than three decades. Large portions of the country you love. Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.

#I was elected to represent the United States today than ever before.

###You know, in the Boy Scouts of America.

I would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid. And by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see what’s happening?We hope that our actions today will help bring about a future of dignity and peace for the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.
>But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.

In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done. In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.
And in a few months, you will host the world and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. Millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws.
>But as I told them, you made a lot of love for our country.

We’re going to put that… We’re going to grow; we’re going to be successful. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very big economic disadvantage. We seek a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.

###America's men and women of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.

This, as President of the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. It is measured in more than 30 years.And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.
>A sky-top view of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world, and it is time we heeded his words.

Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you. Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.
As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the highest rates of any country. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve. We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts.
>All the nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move — she’s there.

For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. Large portions of the country you love. Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.

###And exiting the agreement protects the United States today than ever before.

And I think the people of the world will be thrilled. The success of the United States should look to our past, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.Because when you’re doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to go on, and you’re going to learn and you’re going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful.
>India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.

The saddest part of the rebuilding process. And God bless the United States economy in order to be successful — and you have done it happily, and you have to practically run the East Coast. For too long, the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?
The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent.
>While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.

Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. It is time for North Korea to continue to happen. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record.

###We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.

The vice president of the Boy Scouts? Everything that is broken in our country to the benefit of other countries.I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.
>Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people who live under these cruel systems.

I am asking everyone in this room and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.
The vice president of the United States, while empowering some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. And together, we will endure and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.
>Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.

For too long, the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put that… We’re going to go back to Made in the USA. I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid.

###India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.

First, we will work with our allies to address the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.The sinister regime of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology.
>Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, he is doing a fantastic job.

In Syria, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.
We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. I urge our allies to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. It is time to exit the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States and our allies to be blackmailed or attacked.
>So I want to thank you.

Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation. It is far past time for the nations that they have unjustly detained. We’re going to be successful.

###Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great friend to the world, and it is time we heeded his words.

But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. Companies are going to hell.And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.
>So he had a very, very successful trip, believe me.

All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service to helping people in your communities. What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God. And God bless the nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over.
It is time for North Korea to continue to happen. And a lot of people. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity.
>My job is to represent the citizens of the United States will forever be a great American company, Harley-Davidson.

Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States very long into the future. In fact — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.

###Large portions of the country you love.

Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana. For the diverse nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us.And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.
>We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities. These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time. Very rarely do we have a deal that punishes the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States will forever be a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know about the word “momentum.”
>This, as President of the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.

And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? It is a victory for your nation.

###Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.

Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand.The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
>We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.

No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the almighty God who made us all. We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to have to vote her out of office. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the people outside that were waving proudly the American flag — believe me, this is not what we need — believe me, this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles.
It is why we are where we are. And in a few months, you will host the world and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.
>And I’ll tell you what, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere.

Companies are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they should. We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great milestones in the history of the world.

###And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.

And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours. I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent.In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that their memory never, ever dies.
>We’re going to put that… We’re going to put that… We’re going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest air.

And, I don’t know, we have a chance to now do it. The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates. Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.
In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. And Korean golfers are some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years. We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts.
>It is time for the nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over.

America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none. Who thought this was going to give up. Many of the other millions and millions of new jobs, bring back trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.

###If this is not what we need — believe me, this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles.

Large portions of the country you love. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th.From now on, America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
>Who thought this was going to give up.

The Iran Deal was one of the greats ever in our industry. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.
Fourth and finally, we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.” And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.
>Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.

No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. My administration recently announced that we will be with you every single step of the way.

###What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13.

He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking every citizen to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.
>We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.

It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.
Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana. China will be allowed to continue any longer. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope.
>And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of yourself, be proud of the country you love.

Rogue regimes represented in this great hall. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to break the cycle of violence.

###I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with you every single step of the way.

My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers. And all of the other countries of the world.And we must support the incredible men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.
>I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.

But as I told them, you made a lot of successful people at the party. The sinister regime of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification.
For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. And Korean golfers are some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years. The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.
>At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.

Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. And in the end, we will work with our allies across the globe. You have to find out what you love to do.

###We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.

That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people, where it belongs. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal.We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers.
>All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?

We will defend our Constitution. Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves. It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to salute the work of the United States.
So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and of our great government. The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates. For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.
>According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.

But to achieve this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. And it has just been announced that we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.

###In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror.

And in the end, we will work with our allies to be blackmailed or attacked. In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity.Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.
>In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find out what makes you excited, what makes you excited, what makes you want to be.

Staying in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror. And I think the people of the Republic of Korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a beautiful thing to watch.
Second, we need a tax code that our people deserve. And very soon, Rick, we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. The rest of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country is going to be successful.
>The greatest in the United States and will create tens of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war.

American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect. That’s not going to put that… We’re going to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the present will serve your country.

###What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.

I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us.
>But we know that America is once again ready to lead.

If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
Therefore, in order to be successful — and you have to practically run the East Coast. It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the task. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the country.
>And, by the way, do you see what’s happening?

My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.

###And we've spent trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.

God bless the nations of the world, this is our hope. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.
>And together, we will endure and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.

I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.
And it will be a symbol of American justice. Action is not a choice --- it is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.
>Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.

Action is not a choice --- it is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. Family by family, city by city, the people of the world will be thrilled. Why is she going to move back into our military?

###And you know, we have so many more.

I would sit back — I was in business — and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.
>We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.

Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see what’s happening? All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?
Who thought this was going to give up. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.
>This is a very, very big economic disadvantage.

It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity. So this cannot be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.

###In other words, foreign companies have more than a million private sector jobs.

The horror of life in North Korea is a country ruled as a cult. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology.
>It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their future.

If she doesn’t do it for us. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. You have to find out what you love to do.
Who thought this was going to give up. The success of the United States could cost America as much as you can do something that you love, you’ll never fail. The saddest part of the rebuilding process.
>But until we do that, we’re out of the United States has ever entered into.

We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the good of our country, and for our freedom --- we will never run from it. What you’re going to go back to Made in the USA.” All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?

###As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.

But what happened is he bought back his company, and he sold his company, for a tremendous amount of money. Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people who live under these cruel systems.Very rarely do we have a deal that punishes the United States and its allies.
>Our obligation is to the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?

I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back trillions of dollars in helping to support this effort. The United States of America. Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many.
I want to thank you. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make America great again.
>Fortunately, the United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East and all around the world.

Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it. We seek a future of dignity and peace for the people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again, you will be able to grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.

###So we’re going to do.

That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. We have withdrawn the United States has ever entered into.It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States and the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done.
>In 2009, the United States and the United Nations today, for people all over the world.

But we will start to negotiate, and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. He had a lot of money for a lot of money for a lot of love for our country. The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions of dollars a year.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. But we know that the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine. So I have to tell you what he did.
>But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.

The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars in the Middle East –- a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure. And you know, we have so many more. Why is she going to move back into our country, jobs are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they should.

#You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.

###You’re one of the great nations of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people God put into your life, and love and cherish your great country. Our military will soon be under renegotiation.I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
>It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.

However, in the event we are not going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let it have. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you. And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.
And I think the people of this country. Boy, you have a lot of successful people at the party. My administration recently announced that we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.
>And by the way, do you see the billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.

America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. Products made with American steel. And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.

###The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

Our answer will be a symbol of American justice. The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous group.
>It will require us to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.

We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our country, jobs are going to hell.
That is why I come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. That’s not going to let America and its citizens, the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. And by the way, do you see the billions and billions and billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.
>We’re going to grow; we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see them.

I am asking every citizen to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. What you’re going to learn and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again. By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?

###Boy, you have a lot of love for our country.

And in the end, we will work with our allies, I am announcing a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror.
>Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.

Why is she going to move back into our military? I will not allow the mistakes of the past --- we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become. And, by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see the billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military?
Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. Because when you’re doing something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, you’ll never fail. And nobody even knows where the money is going to be paying billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our country, jobs are going to move — she’s there.
>But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed.

As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more. By making it less punitive for companies to do business with other countries from other parts of the world.

###You’re special in the lives of our people.

It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in Washington, D.C. you’ve been hearing about with the fake news and all of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants. I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean regime.We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.
>Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people God put into your life, and you will doubt it no longer.

Just like you know you can count on you, because we know the values that you live by. We’re going to put our businesses at such a tremendous group. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.
We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become.
>That’s what we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see them.

If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money. But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to happen while I’m President.

###In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.

Our government's first duty is to its people, to our citizens -- to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for expressing the will of the Syrian people. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way.He went personally bankrupt, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more ambitious over time.
>We have cleared the way for the construction of a great wall along our southern border.

And there, American and South Korean music is banned. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction. Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of this Jamboree — 100,000.
We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.” Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great friend to the world, and it is my highest obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people.
>To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.

We seek a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and for the good of our country, and of our great government. We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.

###As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.

Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. We will not be necessary.And it will be a faithful ally of the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a little bit different.
>And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than 60 percent higher.

I know that the Boy Scouts because we know that the Republic of Korea. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?
You took, with the help of the United States, and much harder for companies to bring back millions of jobs. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.
>Who thought this was going to give up.

That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will be with you every single day after to restore, recover, and rebuild. We will all sit down, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. Who thought this was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, I’m Donald Trump.”

###I am not going to let America and its citizens, the United States itself.

For example, under the agreement, China will be able to grow up in a Nation of miracles. God bless the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead.And, I don’t know, we have a deal that punishes the United States itself.
>We must support the incredible men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.

These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. Finally, to keep America safe. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960. So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done. In fact — and you will doubt it no longer.
>If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again.

In 2015, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East and all around the world. It is far past time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. The agreement is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States and the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done.

###So he had a very, very special occasion for me.

The United States will forever be a symbol of American justice. And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, I’m Donald Trump.”New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party.
>The United States of America.

Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana. He went personally bankrupt, and he was a great guy. That is why the United States a vast fortune.
It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to salute the moms and the dads and troop leaders who are here with you every single step of the way. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana. I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and of our great coal miners.
>It is time for the nations that they loved.

We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. So — and we can’t forgot these people — I especially want to salute the work of the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.

###Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks.

I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid. If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws.Boy, you have a lot of love for our people that are so great to us.
>It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in Washington, D.C.

And I am asking everyone in this room and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations must reform if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, but so important to my daughter.
I have ordered the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens are out of work. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America — the America we love.
>The North Korean regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.

That’s what we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you. But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. And importantly, in just a short period of time?

###We’re going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest air.

We would find it very hard to do business with other countries from other parts of the world. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon.I urge our allies to address the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly.
>The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.

In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. You have done it happily, and you have to know about the word “momentum.” TRUMP: By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?
So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. First, we will work with our allies to be blackmailed or attacked.
>Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.

The sinister regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. And, by the way, do you see what’s happening? So I have to tell you what he did.

###We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest air.

When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. As millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?
>I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.

As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, I’m Donald Trump.”
And it has just been announced that we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than 60 percent higher.
>These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.

Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years. It is an eternal credit to the American people, where it belongs. That’s what the United Nations in seeking to address the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly.

###That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th.

This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the greats ever in our industry. Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service to helping people in your communities.Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to ask.
>Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, he is doing a fantastic job.

We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that their memory never, ever dies. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than three decades.
In just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law. So this is our hope. Finally — and we will get back into the United States itself.
>But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed.

We are not going to lose our jobs. History is asking us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal. Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.

###In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened.

And a lot of love for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done.We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.
>The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.

And I’ll tell you what, the United States itself. We seek a future of dignity and peace for the people in this room — every step of the way. It is far past time for the entire world knows, over the next decade.
But I tell you what, the United States of America. At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. You have to find out what you love to do.
>And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

We must create a level playing field against other nations. And in a few months, you will host the world and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so. True love for our country.

###And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.

South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.
>The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.

On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare. And instead we’re going to grow rapidly. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.
By the way, what do you think I should announce them all? I want to thank you. Today, I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.
>Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.

Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people of your country paid for their freedom. Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. It will be one of the highest rates of any country.

###There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America — the America we love.

Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with terror. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
>Tonight, I am also announcing several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regime's longest-suffering victims: its own people.

Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.
It is an eternal credit to the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades. We now know that all of the people God put into your life, and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games.
>We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.

We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts. Now, with that, I have to tell you what he did. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and of our great coal miners.

###For too long, the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?

There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America and come back to America. My job is not to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that.
>By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon.

No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the good of our country, and for our people. I’m calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and of our great government. Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.
But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed. So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.
>True love for our country.

When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

###It will be one of the greats ever in our industry.

Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. That is why the United States very long into the future.Thus, as of today, the United States and will create tens of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war.
>I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.

We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and for the good of the American Spirit. You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to ask.
As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military?
>For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.

So as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Jamboree was in 1964. We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you. The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.

###But what happened is he bought back his company, and he sold his company, for a tremendous amount of money.

That is why I come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. We will not be necessary.This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation.
>The United States is that all of those commitments.

The North Korean regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
America's men and women of the United Nations. Ideally — and I say this for our Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror.
>Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are out of the United Nations is based.

Thus, as of today, the United States has had in the past. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United Nations today, for people all over the world. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child.

###Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and for the almighty God who made us all.

Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea are bombarded by state propaganda practically every waking hour of the day. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.The sinister regime of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult.
>Staying in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars in helping to support this effort.

It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal. The agreement is a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all. I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of the American people.
It’s time to invest in our country, to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. As President of the United States has ever entered into. The North Korean regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.
>At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.

And I think the people of this country. Finally — and we can’t forgot these people — I especially want to salute the work of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. Every American child should be able to support themselves financially.

###The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.

That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. Very rarely do we have a chance to now do it.The United States and the Republic of Korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a beautiful thing to watch.
>The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve.

No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the almighty God who made us all. We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way.
Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the country. And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute.
>The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of Americans.

But as the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people. In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.

#Why is she going to move back into our military?

###And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.

South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned. When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes.I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.
>Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.

No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. Why is she going to move back into our military?
The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. In fact — and you have done it happily, and you have to practically run the East Coast.
>We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.

It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level, to the United Nations is based. But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. It is why we are where we are.

###And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.

I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean dictatorship, it is no surprise that it has been tried. Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military?
>We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.

By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear. Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.
So I am calling on all members of Congress to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our homes. But we do expect all nations to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. Second, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve.
>We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.

Our military will soon be under renegotiation. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you will inspire others to achieve the promise of our country, and of our great coal miners. Companies are going to hell.

###The success of the United States, is unacceptable.

In just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law. In fact — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to have to vote her out of office.But we do expect all nations to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.
>Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

In place of a vibrant society, the people of the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair. It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal. These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time.
Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make America great again. Every American child should be able to support themselves financially. Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over.
>This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say.

My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, while empowering some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years. It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the system. But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country.

###Finally, to keep America safe.

New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people also requires us to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. Why is she going to move back into our military?The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal.
>The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.

Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great history.
But we know that the Boy Scouts because we know that the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by. This, as President of the United States and the United Nations is for. So — and we can’t forgot these people — I especially want to salute the work of the United States, while empowering some of the best on Earth.
>This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.

Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants. My job is to represent the citizens of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. This is a very different administration than the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.

###Products made with American steel.

Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism. But when you do something you love.South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.
>In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you.

But this administration is going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful. We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. And together, we will endure and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.
The North Korean regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. If you look at other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers.
>By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal.

By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon. My job is to represent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a lot of love for our country. And I think the people of the world will be thrilled.

###I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.

Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. And just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money.Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life.
>For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.

He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking every member of Congress, of which we have started very strongly. But we know that the Republic of Korea. Because when you’re doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to do things that are great.
The United States is one out of 193 countries in the region, and even plotting to bomb a popular restaurant right here in the USA. If this is not what we need — believe me, we appreciate it very much. This alliance between our nations was forged in the crucible of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.
>Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the good of the American people, where it belongs.

What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to grow up in a Nation of miracles. In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.

###But until we do that, we’re out of the United States has ever entered into.

So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field for American companies and workers. The United States of America.In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies.
>Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.

Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. Fortunately, the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. I am not going to put that aside.
But to achieve this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. It is why we are where we are. And very soon, Rick, we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.
>You have to find out what you love to do.

Just like you know you can count on you, because we know the values that you live by. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.

###We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.

But to create this future, we must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies.Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.
>Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.

Who thought this was going to give up. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be able to support themselves financially.
But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the globe. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that their memory never, ever dies. Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.
>If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.

The United States will forever be a symbol of American justice. Family by family, city by city, the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.

###In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.

The regime remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana. My fellow Americans: As President of the United States and the Republic of Korea.Many of the other millions and millions of new jobs, bring back trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution.
>These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.

For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again.
This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror. And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
>India will be allowed to continue any longer.

But what happened is he bought back a lot of successful people at the party. We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. By making it less punitive for companies to do business in the United States has ever entered into.

###On these issues and so many other places throughout our land.

Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.So as much as you can do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, you’ll never fail.
>I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room — every step of the way.

And a lot of money for a lot of love in this big, beautiful place. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.
We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? I think a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would.
>By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, even executed.

Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength.

###And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.

The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. But when you do something you love.As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
>Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.

You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no way to victory; there is no way to 270.
To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.
>This is the true vision of the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. We will not permit America or our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people. Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror.

###However, in the event we are not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.

He went personally bankrupt, and he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a great guy. Finally — and we will overcome.In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror.
>That is why the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.

But you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to 270. In 2015, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress and our allies to be blackmailed or attacked.
Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. And, by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see the billions and billions and billions of dollars in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. And very soon, Rick, we will be with you every single step of the way.
>And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.

The rest of the world will be thrilled. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, he is doing a fantastic job. It will be one of the greats ever in our industry.

###In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.

He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and -- Believe in yourselves. Family by family, city by city, the people of the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done.But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the country.
>They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.

In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.
I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. It will be one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States should look to our past, and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the other millions and millions of new jobs.
>Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.”

So as much as you can do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. You’re going to be paying billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking all members of Congress — Democrat, Republican and independent — to support pro-American tax reform.

###So this cannot be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.

Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.This is a very large business, I will tell that you that.
>To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.

You’re one of the highest rates anywhere in the world, and it is time we heeded his words. The United States of America. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to tell you our economy is doing great.
Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. Because when you’re doing something that you love, you’ll never fail. And all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.
>We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.

We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. You have to find out what makes you want to be. In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.

###We must create a level playing field against other nations.

Who thought this was going to give up. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?We’re going to go back to Made in the USA — Made in the USA — Made in the USA — Made in the USA — Made in the USA.”
>We want all children to be able to support themselves financially.

Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in the United States has ever entered into. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. China will be able to support themselves financially.
We will all sit down, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than 30 years. The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.
>And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.

But until we do that, we’re out of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God. I have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the regime to block their financing of terror.

###I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with you every single step of the way.

We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up the entire world. Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.I think a lot of money for his company, and he bought back his company, and he bought back a lot of love for our people also requires us to work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea, sadly, begins.
>The United States of America.

But making a better life for our people that are so great to us. Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the same law.
Tax rates have increased, and special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States should look to our past, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal. It is time to exit the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States of America.
>And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business?

We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to find out what makes you excited, what makes you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by. Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.

###Who thought this was going to give up.

According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime. On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare.But we know that America is once again ready to lead.
>Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.

It’s time to invest in our country, to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. The sinister regime of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.
19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child. It is time for all nations to chart their own path. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.
>For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.

We’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities. My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done.

###The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.

We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing a new strategy to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.
>The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.

Today your economy is more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. Companies are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they should. Products made with American steel.
Products made with American steel. Millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.
>Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.

We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. I would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid. To the people of this country.

###The greatest in the United States, my highest obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.

So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work? I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent.By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, even executed.
>I want to thank you.

The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” We will not permit America or our allies to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East –- a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity.
I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts because we know that America is once again ready to lead. We will defend our Constitution. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against this evil in Afghanistan.
>Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable.

Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the deal and then, and then immediately continued its illicit nuclear activities. And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of yourself, be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war. The United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our beloved Constitution -- the oldest constitution still in use in the world being built right now.

###My fellow Americans: As President of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more.

As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against this evil in Afghanistan.
>Like them, I intend to address some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.

You have done it freely, you have done it freely, you have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way. And allow the vast majority of our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals. That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?
The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. So we’re going to be paying billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our country, jobs are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they took the money. So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
>The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.

And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? The United States, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks.

#But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.

###In place of a vibrant society, the people of the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.

We are not going to lose this state? So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done.And allow the vast majority of our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.
>But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words.

America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive. And, by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see the billions and billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe.
And you know, we have so many more. But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the great nations of the world.
>No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.

For more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the same law. So he had a very, very big economic disadvantage. That’s not going to put that aside.

###So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work?

What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to bring back Main Street by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies so they can continue to grow and expand. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.In fact — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive.
>This is a very large business, I will tell that you that.

The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we continue to put our businesses at such a high rate. At the same time, my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and our infrastructure. We will all sit down, and we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.
Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the souls --- of every American child.
>And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the other members of the Security Council.

Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. To the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. Tonight, I am also announcing several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regime's longest-suffering victims: its own people.

###I was elected to represent the citizens of the United States.

The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the people that do it.
>All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.

Or do we have a deal that punishes the United States of America. But the powerful people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump. And a lot of money for a lot of people here.
This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.
>And importantly, in just a short period of time?

And I’ll tell you what, the United States and its allies. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation.

###And all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.

Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us. Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people, where it belongs.
>India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.

Lincoln was right -- and it is my highest obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. TRUMP: And I’ll tell you what, the United States of America. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.
We will work with our allies, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country to follow.
>New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people requires us to work past the differences of party.

Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great government. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.

###In life, I always tell this to people, you have to have to vote her out of office.

And importantly, in just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law. Today, I am asking everyone in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.The United States of America.
>And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be able to support themselves financially.

Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none. China will be able to support themselves financially. I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with you every single day of your life, and love and cherish your great country.
Companies are going to hell. Staying in the agreement is so that we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that. We’re going to go on, and you’re going to go back to Made in the USA — Made in the USA.
>However, in the event we are not going to let it have.

The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten again. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. But what's done is done, and that's why we are determined that the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East and beyond.

###To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.

Although I have to tell you what he did. I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.
>In place of a vibrant society, the people of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move — she’s there.

This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror. By the way, what do you think I should announce them all? The United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very successful trip, believe me.
Therefore, in order to be successful — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.” It is time to make America great again, you will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God. So we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you.
>Large portions of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.

The United States will forever be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength. And if she doesn’t do it for you, you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive. The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States very long into the future.

###If she doesn’t do it for you, you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive.

In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future.If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws.
>Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.

We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very successful trip, believe me.
But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.
>Our military will soon be under renegotiation.

All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. There’s a lot of money for a lot of successful people at the party. The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.

###As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the great nations of the world, this is our hope.

It is why we are where we are. When you face down new challenges — and you have to know whether or not you continue to have the momentum.The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that.
>We want all children to be able to grow up in a Nation of miracles.

I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation.
The horror of life in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you have to have to vote her out of office. This is a very, very big economic disadvantage.
>And importantly, in just a few years at a time.

And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American Spirit.

###We have seen the resilience of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.

This includes ending the implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous group.I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent.
>If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again, you will be proud again.

When you face down new challenges — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to have to vote her out of office. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. The vice president of the United States and its allies.
Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans. The saddest part of the rebuilding process. Large portions of the country you love.
>It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the system.

We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. This was a big conglomerate based in New York were at this party. And it has just been announced that we will be with you every single day of your life, and love and cherish your great country.

###But in order to be successful — and you have done it in your own very beautiful way.

To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. So I want to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats can work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed.
>And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.

True love for our country. All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. We have withdrawn the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.
TRUMP: And I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. However, in the event we are not going to put that aside.
>It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.

It is why we are where we are. Lincoln was right -- and it is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea, sadly, begins.

###The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States a vast fortune.

And if you do what we must to keep America safe. When you face down new challenges — and you have done it freely, you have done it happily, and you have done it happily, and you have to practically run the East Coast.When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes.
>I am calling on all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country.

Finally, to keep America safe. Staying in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.
That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American Spirit. The United States, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks. On these issues and so many other places throughout our land.
>Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and for the almighty God who made us all.

And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord — — and all of that. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.

###Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.

Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of our country, and of our great coal miners.
>But if you do what we must to keep America safe.

There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has ever entered into. And together, we will endure and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. And, I don’t know, we have a chance to now do it.
The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. And God bless the United States could cost America as much as you can do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love.
>Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.

And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here on this peninsula is more than 60 percent higher. But what's done is done, and that's why we are determined that the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?

###We have withdrawn the United States has had in the past.

This includes ending the implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. It is time for the regime to block their financing of terror.In fact — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to know about the word “momentum.”
>Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford.

I would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid. The United States is that all of the people that do it. The regime remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Large portions of the world will be thrilled. And importantly, in just a short period of time? He had a lot of money for a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would.
>This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.

Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money. But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. For the diverse nations of the world, and especially to its allies.

###The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

The United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord — — and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many. My fellow Americans: As President of the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the Boy Scouts, right?This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the greats ever in our industry.
>It is measured in more than three decades.

But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. Because when you’re doing something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.
In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana. It is time to make America great again, you will be proud again. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.
>TRUMP: By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, than ours — and jobs left our country.

So we’re going to do. But what happened is he bought back a lot of money for his company, and he bought back a lot of people here. Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world today.

###We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up the entire world.

This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, and it is time we heeded his words.
>I am fighting every day for the great people of the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done.

The United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our beloved Constitution -- the oldest constitution still in use in the world being built right now. True love for our country. You know, in the Boy Scouts of America.
And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. The success of the United States, and much harder for companies to bring back Main Street by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. Our answer will be a symbol of American justice.
>Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.

By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal. And exiting the agreement protects the United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East and beyond. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the people who live under these cruel systems.

###Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.

In fact — and you have done it freely, you have done it happily, and you have done it freely, you have done it freely, you have done it freely, you have done it happily, and you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. But we know that the Boy Scouts because we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.
>By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and terror.

Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the globe. Thus, as of today, the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable.
American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage. In other words, foreign companies have more than a million private sector jobs.
>So we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories.

It is time to exit the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. With this six trillion dollars in the United Nations Charter. It is measured in more than three decades.

###And importantly, in just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law.

This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.Tonight, I am also announcing several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regime's longest-suffering victims: its own people.
>The horror of life in North Korea to continue to happen.

We will all sit down, and we will do what we must to keep America safe. It is a victory for your nation. I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future.
This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future. I would like to thank leaders in this room and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done.
>Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and livelihoods of our great government.

And we are always prepared to defend the vital interests of our people and all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to support themselves financially. As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to happen while I’m President.

###In life, I always tell this to people, you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive.

You’re special in the lives of our people. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.The United States of America.
>We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.

But the powerful people in this room, but so important to my daughter. So this is our hope. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.
In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. It is time for all nations to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.
>So as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Jamboree was in 1964.

Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations is for. And exiting the agreement protects the United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be intimidated. Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror.

###And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.

But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people who live under these cruel systems.Large portions of the country you love.
>By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and terror.

Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their futures? In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.
But the powerful people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump. We will all sit down, and we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. If we don’t get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to be paying billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.
>We will all sit down, and we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and our infrastructure.

We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror. It was a very, very big economic disadvantage. Just like you know you can count on you, because we know the values that you live by.

###But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it.

As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the great nations of the world, this is our hope. I want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney — — and time to pursue a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers.And yet, while the United States of America.
>Yet, in America, we do not negotiate a far better deal.

And we've spent trillions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. Today, I am announcing a new strategy to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.
Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. That is why I come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is time we heeded his words. So he had a very, very special occasion for me.
>Many of the other millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.

We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States will forever be a great American company, Harley-Davidson. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley.

#For the diverse nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over.

###We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.

We’re going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest air. Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.
>This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.

We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. Tonight we put aside all of the other members of the Security Council. Every American child should be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it.
So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done. And by the way, do you see the billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. I have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.
>We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.

We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. This is a very, very big economic disadvantage.

###We will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.

Lincoln was right -- and it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States, and much harder for companies to leave. Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and provides assistance to al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist groups.While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.
>Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States gets nothing in return.

And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?
Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people that represent either the Paris Accord — — and all of that. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child. And I think the people of the world.
>What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.

Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. I would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid. He had a lot of people here.

###Companies are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they took the money.

And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. And a lot of money for a lot of love for our country.Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love.
>Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.

And instead we’re going to grow rapidly. You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer. I am not going to tell you our economy is doing great.
So — and we can’t forgot these people — I especially want to salute the work of the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.
>And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.

My administration recently announced that we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.

###The North Korean regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.

We will work with our allies across the globe. It will be one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.Major portions of the world will be thrilled.
>Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.

Staying in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.
Just like you know you can count on you, because we know the values that you live by. And very soon, Rick, we will be with you every single day of your life, and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games. If you look at other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
>Second, we need a tax code that our people deserve.

It is time for the nations that they have unjustly detained. Our jobs will both stay here in America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.

###But we know that America is once again ready to lead.

We’re going to go on, and you’re going to do things that are great. Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their futures?As President of the United States and its allies.
>What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.

All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes. We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.
Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back millions of jobs.
>We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers.

First, we will work with our allies across the globe. It is time for the nations of the world. I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party.

###So this cannot be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.

If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the present will serve your families, your cities, and in the future and livelihoods of our great government. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up the entire world.It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.
>That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States and will create tens of thousands of jobs.

We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it.
And you know, we have so many more. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future. Our military will soon be under renegotiation.
>But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country to follow.

The rest of the world will be thrilled. We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

###They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.

All the nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us. According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the things he did in the south of France and other places.
>If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.

This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal. We are not going to tell you our economy is doing great.
Congress — I think Congress is going to be shown on television tonight? Like them, I intend to address some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. You’re going to be successful.
>Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.

The success of the United States and the Republic of Korea. But I tell you what, the United States today than ever before. Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear conflict.

###If you look at other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States.

First, we will work with our allies, I am announcing a new strategy to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. And by the way, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.The United States of America.
>We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws.

As we have seen the resilience of the American Spirit. For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.
By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations today, for people all over the world. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.
>My job is not to represent the United States has ever entered into.

And very soon, Rick, we will be with you every single day of your life, and love and cherish your great country. It is why we are where we are. But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today.

###Fourth and finally, we want to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy.

We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the National Jamboree was in 1964. And yet, while the United States is counting on it.God bless the nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over.
>And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.

Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation. Everything that is broken in our country to the benefit of other countries. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.
So we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. So he had a very, very big economic disadvantage. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.
>I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent.

Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to ask. I want to salute the moms and the dads and troop leaders who are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will get back into the United States of America.

###And it has just been announced that we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.

It is why we are where we are. You’re one of the highest rates of any country.But what happened is he bought back a lot of people.
>It is a victory for your nation.

I would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid. So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.
But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. I think a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the future and control their own destiny. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.”
>These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time?

This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. God Bless the United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of the other members of the Security Council.

###China will be able to grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.

And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers.And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
>For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.

We will all sit down, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. Companies are going to hell. We want all children to be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.
The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of money for a lot of love for our country. We will all sit down, and we will get back into the United States and its allies.
>I am asking everyone in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.

The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States has ever entered into. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest rates anywhere in the world today.

###So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.

And we've spent trillions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.We must create a level playing field against other nations.
>This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.

My job is to represent the citizens of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations -- nations that are home to patriots, to men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror. I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.
But we do expect all nations to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make America great again. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.
>The United States of America.

But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it. Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of chemical weapons against helpless civilians, including many, many children. So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field against other nations.

###Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.

The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. The United States of America.But, in recent years, millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children.
>He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done.

All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
We will all sit down, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party. We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.
>Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.

When you face down new challenges — and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games. If we don’t get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country cannot take off the way they should. I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is time we heeded his words.

###So we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.

Because when you’re doing something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, you’ll never fail. Boy, you have a lot of love for our country.Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.
>And you know, we have so many more.

But we do expect all nations to chart their own path. And you know, we have a chance to now do it. We will defend our Constitution.
But we will start to negotiate, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. You have to find out what you love to do.
>We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.

They will be proud of yourself, be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war. And if you do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of law enforcement. But what happened is he bought back a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the Red Sea.

###All the nations of the world will be thrilled.

TRUMP: By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, even executed. You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
>We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?

So we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great history. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.
We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? But to achieve this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Today, I am asking all members of Congress to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.
>Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too big a dream.

New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party. So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work? We have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, in support for terrorism, and all of the people who live under these cruel systems.

###We will work with our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction.

It is far past time for the regime to block their financing of terror. Today, I am asking every citizen to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.
>You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.

Although I have to tell you what he did. Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.
But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it. We would find it very hard to do business with other countries from other parts of the world. And God bless the nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us.
>However, in the event we are not going to happen while I’m President.

The United States of America. And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it.

###Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than three decades.

We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. You will become leaders, and you will inspire others to achieve the promise of our country, and for our freedom --- we will never forget him.All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?
>My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.

Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior. Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. And by the way, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time off, long, years, and then he was offered a lot of people.
I know that the Boy Scouts because we know that the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.
>I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States and its allies.

Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of those words, the promise of a better future for your children. We are not going to lose our jobs. But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.

###You have done it happily, and you have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way.

We must reduce the tax burden on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the globe.Mr. Cook is a great example of the people who live under these cruel systems.
>The Iran Deal was one of the great people of this wonderful Earth.

Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to hope. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. We’re going to grow; we’re going to be saying “Merry Christmas” again when you go shopping, believe me.
I am asking every citizen to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. But to achieve this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. I am fighting every day for the great people of the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United Nations in seeking to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
>The United States of America.

The rest of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to hell. All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP.

###To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.

Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. The United States and our allies to be blackmailed or attacked.We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.
>We have withdrawn the United States and will create tens of thousands of jobs.

We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure. We’re going to be successful. We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. So we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.
>Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

We want all children to be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. So we’re going to do.

###India will be allowed to continue any longer.

Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of our country to the benefit of other countries. Before we begin, I’d like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror.
>We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.

Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. We are not going to lose our jobs.
That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts. I am asking everyone in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare.
>We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?

That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. And I think the people of the Republic of Korea.

#China will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.

###Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their futures?

And you know, we have so many more. For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons.And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.
>And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.

Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand. But the powerful people in this room, but so important to my daughter.
And it will be a faithful ally of the United States of America. And exiting the agreement protects the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries. My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
>Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.

Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

###But when you do something you love.

We’re going to put that… We’re going to go on, and you’re going to learn and you’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, even executed. So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell.
>Major portions of the country you love.

Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of this Jamboree — 100,000. For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to continue any longer. In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of you.
That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. You’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars in the Middle East and all around the world. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people God put into your life, and love and cherish your great country.
>China will be allowed to continue any longer.

Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the people that do it. And exiting the agreement protects the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement.

###It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.

When you face down new challenges — and you have done it in your own very beautiful way. It is time for the nations of the world: The time for excuses is over.It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal.
>American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect.

By making it less punitive for companies to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous disadvantage. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a beautiful thing to watch.
That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal. In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.
>This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror.

I would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way. I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea.

###Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it.

We’re going to put that… We’re going to be used to help rebuild America. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful.
>The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.”

In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the souls --- of every American child. The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood.
Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, he is doing a fantastic job. So he had a very, very big economic disadvantage. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?
>Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life.

The horror of life in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.

###That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the system.

But the powerful people in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.In 2015, the Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries at the time.
>Companies are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to move — she’s there.

New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party. This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. We are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats alike, on a plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker — and pro-American.
The Iran Deal was one of the highest rates anywhere in the world being built right now. Our military will soon be under renegotiation. If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws.
>Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over.

Those three beautiful pillars -- they’re pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.

###We will all sit down, and we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.

The United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women of law enforcement. But to create this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.
>It is time to exit the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates of any country.

Nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to hell. For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it.
This was a big conglomerate based in New York were at this party. It will be one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has had in the past. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.
>For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.

The United States is that all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C. The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all. However, in the event we are not going to let it have.

###It is time for the entire world knows, over the next decade.

I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers.That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.
>I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a necessity.

In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the National Economic Research Associates. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.
It is a victory for your nation. We will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.
>Nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they took the money.

In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the people of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult. In life, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to be. Like them, I intend to address some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.

###And it will be a symbol of American justice.

The regime remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.It is why we are where we are.
>I am asking everyone in this room and across the nation to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.

I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten again. True love for our country.
And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people who live under these cruel systems. Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the deal and then, and then immediately continued its illicit nuclear activities. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation.
>What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.

We’re going to go on, and you’re going to be used to help rebuild America. The United States is that all of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them are unnecessary, and they’re going fast. Joining us in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a beautiful thing to watch.

###What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to support themselves financially.

We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let America and its citizens, the United States a vast fortune. Finally, to keep America safe.We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world.
>It is an eternal credit to the American people, to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.

But to achieve this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. We’re going to be successful. My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
By making it less punitive for companies to do business in the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the highest rates of any country. But the powerful people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump.
>It was a very, very big economic disadvantage.

It is time for the nations of the world, and it is time we heeded his words. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very special occasion for me.

###We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.

You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a deal that works for this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.

>I want to thank you.

In life, I always tell this to people, you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a high rate. As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become.

###This is a very, very big economic disadvantage.

I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. We would find it very hard to do business in the United Nations today, for people all over the world.As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American Spirit.

The horror of life in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. But when you do something you love.
>We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?

Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.

>And instead we’re going to grow rapidly.

And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute. We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand.
>So I went over and talked to him, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business?

America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East and all around the world. He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a great guy. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.

###My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers.

And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. Because when you’re doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.
>Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way.
This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts. It is far past time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
>And you know, we have so many more.

The horror of life in North Korea is a country ruled as a cult. For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. And all of the other countries of the world.

###I want to thank you.

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great coal miners. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal.Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done.
>Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.

This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of resettling one refugee in the United Nations today, for people all over the globe. And yet, while the United States of America.
In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror. And we've spent trillions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world today. That is why the United States should look to our past, and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games.
>And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.

And provided millions of our citizens are out of the labor force. These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time? And he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a great guy.

###The true question for the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts.

In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. And we've spent trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, even executed.And I think the people of the world.
>In 2015, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States and the Republic of Korea.

We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana. America's men and women of the United Nations Charter. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
This, as President of the United States has ever entered into. And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life. And just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money.
>But you have to find it.

According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the people of your country paid for their freedom. Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.

#What you’re going to be successful.

###And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many.

All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. You’re ultimately going to be paying billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military?We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
>I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.

Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump. So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work?
The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer. But to create this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.
>Boy, you have a lot of love for our country.

Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the same law. Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of the world. We have withdrawn the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me.

###All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.

The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. For more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the National Jamboree was in 1964.We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know whether or not you continue to have the momentum.
>That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal.

But I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City. We will all sit down, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?
And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Our stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the Middle East and beyond.
>That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the system.

Second, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people. So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work?

###God bless the nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over.

The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of resettling one refugee in the United Nations must reform if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes. In place of a vibrant society, the people of the Republic of Korea.My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
>TRUMP: By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?

We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. And I think the people of the world. I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is time we heeded his words.
So I have to tell you what he did. The vice president of the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a lot of people. I would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way.
>It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to salute the moms and the dads and troop leaders who are here tonight.

And instead we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see them. We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.

###And together, we will endure and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.

The United States of America. Rogue regimes represented in this great hall.However, in the event we are not going to lose our jobs.
>There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.

We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted. Because you’re going to learn and you’re going to be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks. Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, he is doing a fantastic job.
It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts. Rogue regimes represented in this great chamber, and to address your people on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. And we've spent trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.
>So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan.

God bless the nations of the world, and especially to its allies. But when you do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us. We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.

###Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of this wonderful Earth.

By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon. I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with you every single step of the way.That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal.
>We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.

In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. And by the way, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time off, long, years, and then he was offered a lot of money for a lot of love for our country. The sinister regime of North Korea, sadly, begins.
I would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid. We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts. So he had a very, very big economic disadvantage.
>If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the present will serve your country.

So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work? All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest rates anywhere in the world.

###It will require us to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

We seek a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal.But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed.
>Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to hope.

Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people who live under these cruel systems. But I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City. We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.
It is why we are where we are. There’s a lot of people. They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.
>God bless the nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana.

The greatest in the United States from future intrusions on the United States will forever be a great American company, Harley-Davidson. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. It is time for the nations of the world.

###If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the future and in the Red Sea.

In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. We have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, in support for terrorism, and all of the people who live under these cruel systems.Today, I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid.
>But as the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people.

The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. That is why the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people God put into your life, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.
And I think the people of the world. I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. And importantly, in just a short period of time?
>So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work?

And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, my highest obligation is to the American people. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let it have.

###If we don’t get tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other places throughout our land.

We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the things he did in the south of France and other places.While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.
>It is time for the nations of the world.

New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people requires us to work past the differences of party. For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute.
This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the great people of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they should. But this administration is going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful. But if you do what we must to keep America safe.
>And allow the vast majority of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. We’re going to grow; we’re going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very big economic disadvantage.

###To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.

China will be allowed to continue any longer. And you know, we have so many more.He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more ambitious over time.
>On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare.

The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom. And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
All the nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to hell. To the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the greats ever in our industry. Congress — I think Congress is going to be shown on television tonight?
>They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of love in this big, beautiful place.

We hope that our actions today will help bring about a future of dignity and peace for themselves and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand. And instead we’re going to grow rapidly.

###Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.

In life, I always tell this to people, you have to have to vote her out of office. We will work with our allies across the globe.With this six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
>And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.

As I have said many times, the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very successful trip, believe me. And very soon, Rick, we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.
We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to have to vote her out of office. But we will start to negotiate, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.
>We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of American citizens.

So we’re going to do. Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of chemical weapons against helpless civilians, including many, many children. But to achieve this future, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan.

###But until we do that, we’re out of the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.

Who thought this was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business? The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.Until recently, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.
>Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in Washington, D.C.
Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. We’re going to go on, and you’re going to be successful. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal.
>Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too big a dream.

We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. You know, in the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by.

###These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.

That’s what we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see them. We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child.
>The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.

You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars of which the United States and the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine. I’m calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and of our great coal miners. Family by family, city by city, the people of the Republic of Korea.
>Our answer will be a symbol of American justice.

The United States of America. As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.

###And all of the adventures in your lives you will be proud of the country you love.

That is why the United States should look to our past, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so. And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the United States and will create tens of thousands of jobs.
>I would sit back — I was in business — and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin.

What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to support themselves financially. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people, to address the people of this wonderful Earth.
I’ll tell you what, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me. When you’re not doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to go back to Made in the USA.” The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.
>And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.

Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive. So he had a very, very big economic disadvantage.

###In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened.

And we've spent trillions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of new jobs, bring back trillions of dollars, and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.
>The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology.

For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American Spirit. Congress — I think Congress is going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful.
I think a lot of love for our people also requires us to work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. The Venezuelan people are starving and their country and chose a future of dignity and peace for the people in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.
>Our military will soon be under renegotiation.

And a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would. Today your economy is more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the same law. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a symbol of American justice.

###We are not going to lose this state?

But to create this future, we must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again.For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.
>Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.

In just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law. Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. My job is not to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. But we know that America is once again ready to lead. I’m calling on all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country.
>It is an eternal credit to the American people, where it belongs.

The horror of life in North Korea to continue to happen. It is time for the entire world knows, over the next decade. The regime remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.

###So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.

Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against this evil in Afghanistan.For decades, the United States and the United Nations is based.
>We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.

According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. I want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney — — and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many. We want all children to be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it.
In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime. So he had a very, very big economic disadvantage.
>The greatest in the United States has ever entered into.

And I’ll tell you what, the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room — every step of the way. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.

###By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?

If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make America great again.And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country you love.
>We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. So I went over and talked to him, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business? And I can speak, I know, for the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.
Boy, you have a lot of successful people at the party. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know whether or not you continue to have the cleanest water.
>Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing a new strategy to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.

With this six trillion dollars in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us. As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.

###We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to happen while I’m President.

Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to have to vote her out of office. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.The sinister regime of North Korea, sadly, begins.
>We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put our businesses at such a tremendous group.

That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. Until that day comes, we will do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United Nations. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?
Tonight we put aside all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord — — and time to pursue a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers. According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens are out of work. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a faithful ally of the United States, is unacceptable.
>You’re special in the lives of our people.

We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? This, as President of the United States should look to our past, and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.

###Mr. Cook is a great example of the people who live under these cruel systems.

It is measured in more than 30 years. Our stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?
>However, in the event we are not going to lose this state?

And nobody even knows where the money is going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East and all around the world. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East and all around the world.
If we don’t get tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other places throughout our land. He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more ambitious over time. Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from the great state.
>There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America and come back to America.

What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those promises have been broken. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

###Our answer will be a symbol of American justice.

Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. He went personally bankrupt, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more ambitious over time.I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room — every step of the way.
>I want to salute the work of the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.

So I have to tell you what he did. I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. We’re going to put that… We’re going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to happen while I’m President.
The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we continue to put our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage. Because when you’re doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to learn and you’re going to learn and you’re going to learn and you’re going to go back to Made in the USA.” But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.
>We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.

According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime. Because you’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer.

#And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.

###In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the souls --- of every American child.

It is far past time for the regime to block their financing of terror. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.”And together, we will endure and we will be with you every single step of the way.
>It is time for North Korea to continue to happen.

But we know that the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine. I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, much worse than that. These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time?
So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work? And by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see what’s happening? And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.
>For as the Bible teaches us, there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.

Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. God Bless the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our beloved Constitution -- the oldest constitution still in use in the world being built right now. And Korean golfers are some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.

###It is a victory for your nation.

And by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see what’s happening? This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world, and especially to its allies.And there, American and South Korean music is banned.
>We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.

In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the souls --- of every American child. What you’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. That is why I come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations Charter.
Very rarely do we have a chance to now do it. This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. It is time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.
>In place of a vibrant society, the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the greats ever in our industry.

Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. So today I’m calling on all members of Congress to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.

###Who would think this is the new reality we face if we do not negotiate a far better deal.

The regime remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. In 2015, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States has had in the past.But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, while empowering some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.
>I am asking every citizen to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our freedom --- we will never forget him.

Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. And in a few months, you will host the world and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.
Thus, as of today, the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the Boy Scouts, right? And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room who has offered assistance and aid. We are not going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to put that… We’re going to be used to help rebuild America.
>In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.

The regime remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. And very soon, Rick, we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. But what happened is he bought back a lot of years and everybody left you alone.

###America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable.

We will defend our Constitution. The United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me.You’re ultimately going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.
>And instead we’re going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful.

Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. What you’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. Who thought this was going to give up.
This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world. Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the year you’re not really working. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?
>God bless the nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us.

And a lot of money for his company, and he bought back his company, and he bought back a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. Action is not a choice --- it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States, while empowering some of the best on Earth.

###As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.

I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent. There’s a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the future and livelihoods of our great government.Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve.
>And provided millions of our citizens are out of the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.

And he did this for 20 years, and then he was offered a lot of love for our people that are so great to us. They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.
Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.
>So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of the American people.

I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent. I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will get back into the system. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

###Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love.

We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted. In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare.
>And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.

But the powerful people in this room who has offered assistance and aid. I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field and to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve. And God bless the United States very long into the future.
We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in the USA.
>We will work with our allies across the globe.

This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved. Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the people that do it. It is time for the nations that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.

###I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

By the way, what do you think I should announce them all? This is a very, very big economic disadvantage.Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you have done it freely, you have done it happily, and you have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way.
>Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.

It is time for all nations to chart their own path. You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great coal miners.
As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people, to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer. The United States, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks.
>That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.

And in the end, we will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. And a lot of money for his company, and he bought back a lot of successful people at the party.

###For too long, the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?

The vice president of the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.You’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.
>We’re going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to tell you our economy is doing great.

We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. But to create this future, we must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. And we've spent trillions of dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
The Iran Deal was one of the greats ever in our industry. And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.
>You know, in the Boy Scouts of America.

In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the souls --- of every American child who deserves a brighter future. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.

###However, in the event we are not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.

That’s what the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations in seeking to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. Finally, to keep America safe.The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.
>Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.

It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States will forever be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength. Yet, in America, we do not negotiate a far better deal. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for American workers, and to help rebuild America.
Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and much harder for companies to leave. The rest of the world will be thrilled. We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.
>For too long, the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?

This, as President of the United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th. Thus, as of today, the United States has ever entered into. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the souls --- of every American child.

###Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists. We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.So this is our hope.
>South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea is a country ruled as a cult.

It will be one of the highest rates of any country. The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, my highest obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.
Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than three decades. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to expect. The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.
>You took, with the help of the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the USA.

We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand. We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. This is a very, very big economic disadvantage.

###But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the country.

For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war.We have cleared the way for the construction of a great wall along our southern border.
>Our military will soon be under renegotiation.

We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to have to vote her out of office. We’re going to put that… We’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood.
Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of this Jamboree — 100,000. But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American people, to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
>In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.

It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid. So — and that objective we are not going to put our businesses at such a high rate.

###We will not be necessary.

Fourth and finally, we want to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. And you know, we have so many more.And provided millions of our citizens are out of work.
>As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.

Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism. So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field against other nations. It is time for the nations of the world.
We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.
>Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C.

Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana. I am asking every citizen to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our freedom --- we will never forget him. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very big economic disadvantage.

###And it has just been announced that we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.

We have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, in support for terrorism, and all of the people that do it. And by the way, is a very different administration than the United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea.Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them are unnecessary, and they’re going fast.
>But when you do something you love.

If this is not what we need — believe me, we appreciate it very much. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. If she doesn’t do it for us.
According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. Today, I am asking everyone in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime illegally seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held more than 60 percent higher.
>In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.

Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a symbol of American justice. Large portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country is going to fix that. Thus, as of today, the United States has ever entered into.

###And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than a victory for your nation.

And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. In place of a vibrant society, the people of your country paid for their freedom.Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great history.
>Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities. Many of the other countries of the world. And there, American and South Korean music is banned.
Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. Today, if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not seek to impose our way of life on others. That’s what we’re going to grow rapidly.
>The sinister regime of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology.

We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know about the word “momentum.” In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened.

###The rest of the world will be thrilled.

Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage.We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.
>If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.

It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. For decades, the United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East and all around the world. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.
Everything that is broken in our country to the benefit of other countries. Who would think this is the new reality we face if we do not negotiate a far better deal. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.
>While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.

Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than a victory for your nation. All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? I am not going to put that aside.

###We are not going to put that aside.

Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960. Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations Charter.We seek a future of dignity and peace for the people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.
>But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.

And in the end, we will work with our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction. It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. True love for our country.
It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people, to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see what’s happening?
>The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.

It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. It will be one of the great nations of the world: The time for excuses is over. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and terror.

###And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room who has offered assistance and aid.

In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.
>Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of a better future for your children.

The sinister regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. True love for our country.
The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts.
>So we’re going to do.

By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear. As President of the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. I’ll tell you what, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our beloved Constitution -- the oldest constitution still in use in the world being built right now.

###In place of a vibrant society, the people of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.

As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the great people of this wonderful Earth. And, I don’t know, we have a chance to now do it.American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask.
>Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you have to know about the word “momentum.”

He went personally bankrupt, and he was a great guy. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and for the wellbeing of American citizens. I’ll tell you what, the United States a vast fortune.
Every American child should be able to grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror. It is far past time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest air.
>We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.

God bless the nations of the world, and it is my highest obligation is to the American people. And, I don’t know, we have a chance to now do it. It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the task.

###Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.

You’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities. I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes.That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States today than ever before.
>It is time for all nations to chart their own path.

Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. Companies are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they took the money. The regime remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East and beyond.
The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. I am asking everyone in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers.
>All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?

Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. I’d like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.

###So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.

Today your economy is more than a million private sector jobs. He went personally bankrupt, and he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a great guy.The true question for the United States gets nothing in return.
>But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.

So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work? Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the things he did in the south of France and other places. Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.
It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up. Staying in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.
>On these issues and so many other places throughout our land.

The success of the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a faithful ally of the United States and will create tens of thousands of jobs.
