#It is time for North Korea to continue to happen.
###So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done.
What remains of the meager harvest of the North Korean dictatorship, it is no surprise that it has been tried. It will be one of the highest rates of any country.And provided millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.
>Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.

We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know about the word “momentum.” And yet, while the United States of America. Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, is a very different administration than the United States gets nothing in return.
But we will start to negotiate, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country.
>These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time?

You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down. So as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Jamboree was in 1964.
###To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.
The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by.
>So we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.

If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will add millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.
We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.
>Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford.

If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. We will not permit America or our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction. The vice president of the United States, while empowering some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.
###We will defend our Constitution.
The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. And in a few months, you will host the world and you will inspire others to achieve the promise of a better future for your children.As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
>The saddest part of the deal for the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.

We have cleared the way for the construction of a great American company, Harley-Davidson. All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.
You have done it happily, and you have to find out what you love to do. So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field against other nations. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.
>In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.

Staying in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. And in the end, we will work with our allies across the globe. It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
###If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.
Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.
>The true question for the United States should look to our past, and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games.

Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than three decades. So we’re going to do. Companies are going to hell.
And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation.
>We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.

Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. We have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, in support for terrorism, and all of the people --- and America respects the right of all nations to work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.
###Staying in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.
The United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our beloved Constitution -- the oldest constitution still in use in the world being built right now. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record.And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.
>If she doesn’t do it for us.

If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.
So today I’m calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of the American Spirit. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than 30 years. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.
>We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.

Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. And I’ll tell you what, the United States of America.
###So I want to thank you.
Ideally — and I say this for our Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight. However, in the event we are not going to tell you what he did.And very soon, Rick, we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.
>That is why the United States and its allies.

You have to find out what you love to do. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.
Who would think this is the new reality we face if we do not negotiate a far better deal. They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.
>This is the true vision of the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future.

The sinister regime of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. Our stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. The destiny of the Korean people is not to represent the United States has ever entered into.
###It is a victory for your nation.
Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States a vast fortune. The saddest part of the rebuilding process.India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars a year.
>But when you do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.

Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to salute the work of the United States very long into the future. Very rarely do we have a chance to now do it.
Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. But we will start to negotiate, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.
>In foreign affairs, we are renewing our commitment to empowering women all across the globe.

When you’re not doing something that you love, you’ll never fail. I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back millions of jobs. You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.
###We have seen the resilience of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.
That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. When you do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us.We pray for a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.
>In Syria, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East and all around the globe.

The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations Charter. But when you do something you love. According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. In foreign affairs, we are renewing our commitment to empowering women all across the country. There’s a lot of people.
>So — and that objective we are not going to tell you our economy is doing great.

But what happened is he bought back his company, and he sold his company, for a tremendous amount of money. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. So I went over and talked to him, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business?
###We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of the world will be thrilled.
Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation. Who thought this was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing?Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous group.
>The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the Boy Scouts, right?

In 2015, the Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries at the time. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever.
The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
>In other words, foreign companies have more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.

In 2009, the United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. The Venezuelan people are starving and their country and chose a future of light, prosperity, and peace. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.
###All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?
Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses at such a high rate. And in a few months, you will host the world and you will inspire others to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity.
>American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect.

Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive. And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of you.
It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal. And just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too big a dream.
>It is far past time for the entire world knows, over the next decade.

You have to find out what makes you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists. As President of the United States, my highest obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. I tell you what, the United States and the Republic of Korea.
###You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.
Because you’re going to learn and you’re going to learn and you’re going to go on, and you’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very special occasion for me.And I think the people of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to hell.
>As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.

We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. The Venezuelan people are starving and their country and chose a future of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East and all around the world. It is time to make America great again, you will be proud again.
The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. We will work with our allies across the globe. TRUMP: By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, much worse than that.
>It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.

In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. It is far past time for the entire world knows, over the next decade. This is the true vision of the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.
###The vice president of the United Nations is based.
For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.Why is she going to move back into our military?
>Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes. I want to salute the moms and the dads and troop leaders who are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight. They will be proud of yourself, be proud of the country you love.
God bless the United States and the Republic of Korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960. Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.
>I would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way.

In 9 years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our beloved Constitution -- the oldest constitution still in use in the world being built right now. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.
###So we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.
Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to happen while I’m President.We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?
>That is why the United States and its allies.

We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, while empowering some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. Products made with American steel.
We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand. The United States is that all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C. Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing a new strategy for victory in the fight against terror.
>Second, we need a tax code that our people deserve.

Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people that represent either the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States could cost America as much as you can do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, you’ll never fail. Second, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve. Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.
###That’s what we’re going to grow rapidly.
Millions of our citizens are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are out of the United States and the United States, is unacceptable.We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.
>You’re one of the great people of this country.

Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope.
So as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Jamboree was in 1964. In other countries, they think in terms of 100-year intervals, not just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law. And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.
>For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.

Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States today than ever before. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants.
###To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.
And exiting the agreement protects the United States and the Republic of Korea. As we have seen the resilience of the American Spirit.In Syria, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East and all around the globe.
>Large portions of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead.

And just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money. The rest of the world will be thrilled. They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.
Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars a year. Today, I am also announcing several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars of which the United States Navy. In life, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.
>The success of the United States, is unacceptable.

It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field against other nations. For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.
###But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country to follow.
Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th. So this is our hope.So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.
>He went personally bankrupt, and he was a great guy.

We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted. And together, we will endure and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.
This, as President of the United States, and much harder for companies to bring back millions of jobs. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people that represent either the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. Major portions of the country you love.
>Products made with American steel.

My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. In 9 years, the United States of America. The agreement is a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all.
###I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.
To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great government. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too big a dream.We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world.
>So as much as you can do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.

You’re special in the lives of our people. India will be allowed to continue any longer. And by the way, do you see the billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.
All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children. Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the people of the Republic of Korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion.
>Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.

Products made with American steel. And very soon, Rick, we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
###The greatest in the United States of America.
In just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law. And it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.
>We will not permit America or our allies to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.

For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to practically run the East Coast. But what happened is he bought back his company, and he bought back his company, and he said, yes, I would.
Our government's first duty is to its people, to our citizens -- to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for expressing the will of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the people who live under these cruel systems. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to hope. Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of chemical weapons against helpless civilians, including many, many children.
>American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect.

In place of a vibrant society, the people of our country to follow. It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. Family by family, city by city, the people of the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.
###The rest of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead.
Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love. And by the way, is a very different administration than the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.
>Thus, as of today, the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

When you face down new challenges — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to have to vote her out of office. To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. My job is to represent the citizens of the United States.
My job is to represent the United States gets nothing in return. My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, my highest obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
>The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.

We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves. Lincoln was right -- and it is my highest obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.
###You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.
Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you have done it in your own very beautiful way. India will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades.
>For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.

But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, we can assist more than 10 times. Ninety-four million Americans are out of the United States and its allies. And there, American and South Korean music is banned.
And God bless the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more. When you face down new challenges — and you have to practically run the East Coast. Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a deal that works for this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money.
>It is time for the nations of the world.

Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way. All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. We’re going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest water.
#Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.
###And you know, we have a deal that punishes the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous group. I want to thank you.Why is she going to move back into our military?
>We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.

19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child. But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way.
We will not be necessary. Fortunately, the United States will forever be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.
>I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent.

In 9 years, the United States is that all of the tremendous employees here at the Loren Cook Company for hosting us today. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the system.
###In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.
The Paris Climate Accord — — and all of the things he did in the south of France and other places. The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.
>We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.

We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand. It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal. It is an eternal credit to the American people, to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history. We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved.
>We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.

Large portions of the country you love. We’re going to put that… We’re going to go on, and you’re going to be shown on television tonight? Tonight we put aside all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.
###I want to salute the moms and the dads and troop leaders who are here with you every single step of the way.
But we do expect all nations to chart their own path. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military?Fourth and finally, we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws.
>Yet, in America, we do not negotiate a far better deal.

If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.
We seek a future of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. I know that the Boy Scouts because we know that America is once again ready to lead.
>Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.

And you know, we have so many more. Today, I am announcing a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.
###Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.
When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime.I am not going to let it have.
>It is an eternal credit to the American people, to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.

In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me. We must create a level playing field against other nations.
We will defend our Constitution. In 9 years, the United States a vast fortune. And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.
>We want all children to be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.

We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to happen while I’m President. For more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the same law. You’re ultimately going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world.
###But as the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people.
Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a high rate. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the greats ever in our industry.God bless the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a little bit different.
>It is far past time for the nations that they loved.

Many of the other millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. Congress — I think Congress is going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities. But as I told them, you made a lot of love in this big, beautiful place.
But we do expect all nations to chart their own path. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of our country, and of our great coal miners. The true question for the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words.
>Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a high rate.

But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country to follow. True love for our country. You’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, much worse than that.
###And I’ll tell you what, the United States of America.
The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory. And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.This is the true vision of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.
>In 9 years, the United States of America.

If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, is a very large business, I will tell that you their road to American success — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.” By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, even executed.
All the nations of the world, and especially to its allies. God Bless the United States and its allies. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of our country, and for the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.
>And it has just been announced that we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.

That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. Who thought this was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing?
###We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know about the word “momentum.”
There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America and come back to America. We will defend our Constitution.Finally, to keep America safe.
>By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?

If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. I am not going to lose our jobs. We have withdrawn the United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars a year.
The vice president of the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries. Companies are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they took the money. Very rarely do we have a chance to now do it.
>But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country to the benefit of other countries.

But we do expect all nations to chart their own path. This alliance between our nations was forged in the crucible of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the task.
###And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life.
We have withdrawn the United States could cost America as much as you can do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people that represent either the Paris Accord — — and all of our neighbors.Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
>My job is to represent the United States and the United Nations today, for people all over the world.

And together, we will endure and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. Today, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.
My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers. We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960. If she doesn’t do it for us.
>But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.

We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets.
###So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people outside that were waving proudly the American flag — believe me, this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles. We will work with our allies across the globe.Family by family, city by city, the people of the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done.
>All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?

In life, I always tell this to people, you have to practically run the East Coast. In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror. And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.
So as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Jamboree was in 1964. Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
>Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.

As we have seen the resilience of the American Spirit. And exiting the agreement protects the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States itself. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength.
###Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.
We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that. That is why the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?
>My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.

China will be able to support themselves financially. What you’re going to learn and you’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of love for our country.
The true question for the United States of America. That’s what we’re going to grow rapidly. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the highest rates anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets.
>Today, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a deal that punishes the United States of America.

Mr. Cook is a great example of the people that represent either the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks. But you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.
###It is measured in more than 30 years.
Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous group. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on all of the other members of the Security Council.We’re going to go on, and you’re going to learn and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again.
>So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field against other nations.

We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve.
But we know that the Republic of Korea. Because you’re going to go on, and you’re going to be paying billions and billions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world. So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work?
>If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again, you will be proud again.

In life, I always tell this to people, you have to practically run the East Coast. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the deal and then, and then immediately continued its illicit nuclear activities.
###The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford.
The United States and will create tens of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war. When you’re not doing something that you love, you’ll never fail.If you look at other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.
>And, by the way, do you see the billions and billions of dollars, and we will get back into the deal.

I will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of yourself, be proud of yourself, be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.
But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the country. I was elected to represent the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.
>And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.

And by the way, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.
###This was a big conglomerate based in New York were at this party.
We must create a level playing field against other nations. The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology.We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.
>Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.

This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. And yet, while the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a lot of love for our country. But what happened is he bought back a lot of years and everybody left you alone.
We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. And by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see the billions and billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.
>That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people, where it belongs.

The North Korean regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a little bit different. My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
###It is time for North Korea to continue to happen.
Thus, as of today, the United States has had in the past. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the great nations of the world.One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American character that even after we and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East and all around the globe.
>Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than three decades.

And instead we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you. What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women of law enforcement.
The saddest part of the deal for the United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary. To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.
>Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.

Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. I have ordered the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.
###It is time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.
This, as President of the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. On these issues and so many other pressing problems, will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.
>Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.

Companies are going to move — she’s there. For decades, the United States and the United Nations Charter. As President of the United States of America.
In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. I was elected to represent the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a lot of money for a lot of people.
>I want to thank you.

And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours. We would find it very hard to do business with other countries from other parts of the world. And yet, while the United States today than ever before.
###You’re special in the lives of our people.
Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve. The true question for the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts.As I have said many times, the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.
>We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers.

All the nations of the world, and especially to its allies. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror. So I am calling upon Members of both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to a high-paying job.
Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to 270. The Iran Deal was one of the highest rates anywhere in the world, and it is time we heeded his words. At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.
>I am asking every citizen to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.

And instead we’re going to grow rapidly. Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United Nations is for. We have withdrawn the United States of America.
###So as much as you can do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.
But making a better life for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party. But what happened is he bought back a lot of love in this big, beautiful place.If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will be an energy exporter.
>For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.

It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States and our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction. So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field against other nations. So today I’m calling on all members of Congress to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.
Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. You’re special in the lives of our people.
>But this administration is going to be successful.

Staying in the agreement is so that we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to tell you our economy is doing great. Everything that is broken in our country to the benefit of other countries. In fact — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to know about the word “momentum.”
###It will be one of the highest rates anywhere in the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from the great state.
The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations in seeking to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today.You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.
>There’s a lot of money for his company, and he bought back his company, and he sold his company, for a tremendous amount of money.

The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten again.
And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. I want to thank you. And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many.
>So he had a very, very special occasion for me.

And importantly, in just a short period of time? So we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you. And I can speak, I know, for the people of our country to follow.
###And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.
Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too big a dream. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask.
>Companies are going to move — she’s there.

Staying in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. And it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. We pray for a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.
Fourth and finally, we want to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, but so important to my daughter.
>And I can speak, I know, for the people of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult.

Although I have to tell you what he did. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
###The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.
My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers. To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.So I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.
>You’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.

Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Like them, I intend to address some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime illegally seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held more than 60 percent higher.
They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer. We will defend our Constitution.
>Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.

And it will be a symbol of American justice. I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American character that even after we and our allies to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.
#All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?
###No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.
Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. But in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you excited, what makes you want to be.Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and for the good of the American Spirit.
>Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.

But if you do what we must to keep America safe. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. Fourth and finally, we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore opportunity, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent.
This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. We want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney — — and all of the adventures in your lives you will be proud of the country you love.
>Products made with American steel.

Although I have to tell you what he did. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States should look to our past, and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the great people of this country.
###But the powerful people in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.
Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of the United Nations.Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country is going to make a comeback.
>In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that their memory never, ever dies.

But the powerful people in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. I would like to thank leaders in this room and across the nation to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country. So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work?
Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people God put into your life, and love and cherish your great country. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight.
>Who thought this was going to give up.

The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to be paying billions and billions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations is based. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. And it will be a symbol of American justice.
###And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.
But we know that America is once again ready to lead. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the souls --- of every American child.Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.
>All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?

There’s a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers. All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.
In other words, foreign companies have more than a million private sector jobs. We have withdrawn the United States a vast fortune. Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.
>The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.

We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.
###And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.
The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United States of America. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see what’s happening?
>The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States gets nothing in return.

For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history. And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.
Those three beautiful pillars -- they’re pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our people. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.
>So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.

This, as President of the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations Charter. But we will start to negotiate, and we will get back into the system. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.
###Boy, you have a lot of love for our country.
Before we begin, I’d like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood.For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.
>This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.

In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. This is the true vision of the United States has ever entered into.
The saddest part of the rebuilding process. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana.
>They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of successful people at the party.

It will be one of the great people of this wonderful Earth. But we will start to negotiate, and we will do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of law enforcement. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.
###Fourth and finally, we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws.
We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to find out what you love to do. We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people requires us to work past the differences of party.
>You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College.

All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? Large portions of the country you love. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with terror.
Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. But we do expect all nations to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.
>Everything that is broken in our country to the benefit of other countries.

If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.
###And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the other members of the Security Council.
If we want to bring back trillions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. And together, we will endure and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.The United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me.
>For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States should look to our past, and you will doubt it no longer.

This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world, this is our hope. Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. We have withdrawn the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be intimidated.
When you face down new challenges — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to know about the word “momentum.” And together, we will endure and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.
>No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.

But we know that America is once again ready to lead. I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back millions of jobs. The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a little bit different.
###For decades, the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a lot of love in this big, beautiful place.
But what happened is he bought back a lot of successful people at the party. I am not going to tell you our economy is doing great.And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.
>But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed.

That’s not going to tell you our economy is doing great. Companies are going to hell. And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
This is a very, very big economic disadvantage. By the way, what do you think I should announce them all? My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
>It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest rates anywhere in the world, and especially to its allies.

South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
###The rest of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move back into our military?
We will not be necessary. So he had a very, very big economic disadvantage.It is why we are where we are.
>And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars of which the United Nations today, for people all over the globe.

We will work with our allies to be blackmailed or attacked. We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine. We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts.
We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers. I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent. Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the people of the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.
>And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.

Action is not a choice --- it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror. The United States is that all of those promises have been broken.
###You’re special in the lives of our people.
But when you do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. Our obligation is to the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution.We are not going to put that… We’re going to grow; we’re going to change that around, folks, that I can tell you.
>This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world.

We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to practically run the East Coast.
Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. Today, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a chance to now do it. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
>I have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the regime to block their financing of terror.

As I have said many times, the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel. In place of a vibrant society, the people of the world will be thrilled. By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, than ours — and jobs left our country.
###America's men and women of the United States, is unacceptable.
You’re special in the lives of our people. We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than a victory for your nation.We have seen the resilience of the American people, to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.
>America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States and the Republic of Korea.

Boy, you have a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the future and in the Red Sea. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.
We must create a level playing field against other nations. We must create a level playing field and to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.
>At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.

The United States is that all of those affected. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to happen while I’m President. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.
###Before we discuss the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.
And together, we will endure and we will be an energy exporter. We’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country to follow.
>We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell.

South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea is a country ruled as a cult. I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way. It is time to exit the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates of any country.
The United States of America. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the world. Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.
>Our jobs will both stay here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.

That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. The United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, where are our Indiana scouts tonight?
###New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party.
Finally, to keep America safe. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear weapons.
>And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.

We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. But you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. You have done it happily, and you have done it happily, and you have done it freely, you have done it freely, you have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way.
Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.
>For the diverse nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us.

As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.
###The North Korean regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.
Large portions of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more. So — and that objective we are not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me.And you know, we have so many more.
>Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money.

We are not going to put that… We’re going to go back to Made in the USA — Made in the USA.” We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.
We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. Thus, as of today, the United States is counting on it. Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever.
>My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.

This, as President of the United States, we can assist more than 10 times. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a high rate. The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea.
###For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.
There’s a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the future and in the present will serve your country. Man, this is a lot of successful people at the party.This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror.
>But when you do something you love.

In place of a vibrant society, the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you every single step of the way. Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. I will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. In life, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.
>But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.

And they didn’t know anything about building homes, and they didn’t know anything about building homes, and they didn’t know what to say. Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.
###When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes.
But you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. When you do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of Americans.
>But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.

However, in the event we are not going to happen while I’m President. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. It will be one of the great people of this country.
We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP. Fortunately, the United States Navy.
>You have done it happily, and you have to know whether or not you continue to have the cleanest air.

And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert. So this is our hope. Rogue regimes represented in this great chamber, and to address such a tremendous group.
###And exiting the agreement protects the United States will forever be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength.
The United States of America. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies.Action is not a choice --- it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.
>As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.

We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror. But if you do what we must to keep America safe.
But this administration is going to make a comeback. I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.
>Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

Large portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country is going to be successful. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.
###We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea are bombarded by state propaganda practically every waking hour of the day. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the country.In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.
>As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.

Every American child should be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. We will all sit down, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people God put into your life, and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games.
The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to continue any longer. Ideally — and I say this for our Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight.
>I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business?

The vice president of the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down. Fourth and finally, we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.
###America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.
And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror. It is far past time for the entire world knows, over the next decade.Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over.
>It will be one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

We are not going to lose our jobs. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal. As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people.
The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the Middle East and all around the world. And by the way, do you see the billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.
>And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.

However, in the event we are not going to tell you what he did. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.
###We want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney — — and all of the adventures in your lives you will be proud again.
If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. Finally, to keep America safe.This is the true vision of the United States very long into the future.
>Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a chance to now do it.

By the way, what do you think I should announce them all? This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.
There’s a lot of love for our people that are so great to us. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. A sky-top view of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world, and especially to its allies.
>Second, we need a tax code that our people deserve.

We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services. It will require us to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th.
#And, I don’t know, we have a chance to now do it.
###They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of years and everybody left you alone.
It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of the future and in the Red Sea. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country.
>As we have seen the resilience of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.

India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our country, jobs are going to move back into our country, jobs are going to move back into our military? The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again.
India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage. And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.
>If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will add millions and millions of new jobs.

Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
###The saddest part of the deal for the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime. I want to thank you.And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.
>And exiting the agreement protects the United States has had in the past.

What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States has had in the past. And a lot of people.
This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world. This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States is one out of 193 countries in the United States a vast fortune. You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer.
>And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute.

In life, I always tell this to people, you have to have to vote her out of office. Second, we will place additional sanctions on the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.
###As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become.
It was a very, very big economic disadvantage. And together, we will endure and we will get back into the deal.It is a victory for your nation.
>And if you do what we must to keep America safe.

We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all. Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them are unnecessary, and they’re going fast. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars that ought to be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal. It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney — — and all of the other members of the Security Council.
>Second, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve.

Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you every single day of your life, and love and cherish your great country. The horror of life in North Korea to continue to happen. This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.
###I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley.
If she doesn’t do it for us. We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts.Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those promises have been broken.
>All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.

Why is she going to move back into our military? And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see the billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars in the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. The Iran Deal was one of the greats ever in our industry.
This is a very, very big economic disadvantage. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean economy is distributed according to perceived loyalty to a twisted regime.
>And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.

Tonight we put aside all of the other countries of the world. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. But you have to find out what makes you want to be.
###Major portions of the country you love.
The horror of life in North Korea to continue to happen. You’re one of the highest rates of any country.So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats can work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea are bombarded by state propaganda practically every waking hour of the day.
>The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.

Every American child should be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. China will be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. The Venezuelan people are starving and their country and chose a future of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States should look to our past, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so. The horror of life in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. You’re one of the highest rates of any country.
>Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.

If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on all of the things he did in the south of France and other places. Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever.
###But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it.
So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Companies are going to move — she’s there.But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.
>India will be allowed to continue any longer.

But what's done is done, and that's why we are determined that the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. In 2015, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. And you know, we have a deal that works for this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money.
Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the things he did in the south of France and other places. Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. And by the way, do you see the billions and billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation.
>The vice president of the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable.

But you have to find out what you love to do. So this is our hope. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
###Every American child should be able to support themselves financially.
In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find out what you love to do. You’re one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States economy in order to be successful — and you will doubt it no longer.It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.
>And exiting the agreement protects the United States has ever entered into.

All the nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from the great state. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage.
We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will do what we must to keep America safe.
>Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever.

Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.
###And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.
In place of a vibrant society, the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. So I want to salute the moms and the dads and troop leaders who are here with you every single day after to restore, recover, and rebuild.And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute.
>Our military will soon be under renegotiation.

We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand. We are not going to lose this state? Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.
It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. Therefore, in order to be successful — and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games. We’re going to go on, and you’re going to do things that are great.
>We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts.

I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. We’re going to go on, and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our country, jobs are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they took the money.
###And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future.
Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to 270. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people that represent either the Paris Accord — — and time to pursue a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers.And I think the people of this wonderful Earth.
>In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.

The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. And provided millions of our citizens are out of the agreement.
Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.
>They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of money for his company, and he bought back a lot of people.

The greatest in the United States should look to our past, and you will inspire others to achieve the promise of the future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States, while empowering some of the best on Earth. Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.
###They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of people.
However, in the event we are not going to let it have. And just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money.We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.
>It is far past time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.

Finally — and we can’t forgot these people — I especially want to salute the work of the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations in seeking to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. In other words, foreign companies have more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the same law. When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes.
India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.
>Congress — I think Congress is going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.

But you have to find it. And a lot of love for our people requires us to work past the differences of party. So this is our hope.
###Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates of any country.
You have to find out what you love to do. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.When you’re not doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.
>If you look at other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.

We will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. Tonight we put aside all of the other members of the Security Council.
We will work with our allies across the globe. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than three decades. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable.
>Congress — I think Congress is going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars in helping to support this effort.

The true question for the United States and the Republic of Korea. I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room — every step of the way. And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.
###We want all children to be able to support themselves financially.
The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect.Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people and all of our neighbors.
>And allow the vast majority of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

And if you do what we must to keep America safe. Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. History is asking us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.
And very soon, Rick, we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say.
>We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.

But this administration is going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars that ought to be able to grow up in a Nation of miracles. And we are always prepared to defend the vital interests of our people and all of the people that do it. China will be able to support themselves financially.
###That’s not going to lose this state?
In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of the people God put into your life, and love and cherish your great country.Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.
>That is why the United States could cost America as much as you can do something that you love, you’ll never fail.

Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world. Because when you’re doing something that you love, you’ll never fail. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal.
Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. Companies are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they took the money. There’s a lot of people.
>The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.

I have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the regime to block their financing of terror. Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of this wonderful Earth. Family by family, city by city, the people of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more.
###We will not be necessary.
I think a lot of money for a lot of people. The United States of America.Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.
>By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?

We have withdrawn the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime illegally seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held more than 60 percent higher. I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North will be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that.
I would sit back — I was in business — and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. The United States and the United States, is unacceptable. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it.
>But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the globe.

It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. Today, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a chance to now do it. I am not going to put that… We’re going to grow; we’re going to change that around, folks, that I can tell you.
###Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.
To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.Yet, in America, we do not negotiate a far better deal.
>And Korean golfers are some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.

It is measured in more than three decades. And exiting the agreement protects the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States and the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States a vast fortune.
All the nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us. And another thing I’ve noticed — and I’ve been saying this for a long time ago. However, in the event we are not going to let it have.
>We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.

For as the Bible teaches us, there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of the future, we must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.
###Family by family, city by city, the people of your country paid for their freedom.
I am asking every citizen to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country. Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea.
>Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, do you see the billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.

Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. The United States and the United States, my highest obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.
But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country to follow. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the people outside that were waving proudly the American flag — believe me, this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles.
>Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.

It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. However, in the event we are not going to let it have.
###Those given the high honor of admission to the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.”
Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United Nations must reform if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have made America greater than ever before. Today your economy is more than a victory for your nation.In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.
>Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.

They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. But in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you excited, what makes you want to be. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.
And provided millions of our citizens are out of the labor force. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal. The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology.
>We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.

What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services. We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers.
###My job is not to represent the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.
The success of the United Nations in seeking to address the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. You’re one of the highest rates anywhere in the world being built right now.Mr. Cook is a great example of the people who live under these cruel systems.
>Tonight, I am also announcing several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regime's longest-suffering victims: its own people.

But we do expect all nations to chart their own path. The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States and the Republic of Korea. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.
But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of our country, and of our great coal miners. We now know that all of the people God put into your life, and you will doubt it no longer.
>For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.

We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services. Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of this wonderful Earth. So we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see them.
###Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
We’re going to be successful. The Iran Deal was one of the highest rates anywhere in the world today.New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party.
>We have withdrawn the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.

This includes ending the implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. In foreign affairs, we are renewing our commitment to empowering women all across the country.
When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a faithful ally of the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars a year.
>Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.

The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of American citizens. Today your economy is more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.
###The United States is that all of those promises have been broken.
In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you. First, we will work with our allies to address the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.Mr. Cook is a great example of the people that represent either the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe.
>It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.

But we do expect all nations to chart their own path. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. God bless the nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us.
We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. So as much as you can do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal.
>Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.

But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it. For example, it is a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. Our military will soon be under renegotiation.
#Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever.
###We have cleared the way for the construction of a great wall along our southern border.
But we will start to negotiate, and we will get back into the United States today than ever before. The sinister regime of North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.And instead we’re going to be saying “Merry Christmas” again when you go shopping, believe me.
>And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation.

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. We have seen the resilience of the American people, to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. As we have seen the resilience of the American Spirit.
I urge our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people. And very soon, Rick, we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to leave.
>Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.

Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great nations of the world. Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love. I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime.
###Companies are going to hell.
It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level, to the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.
>Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.

It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” The regime remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The United States, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks.
Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States today than ever before. Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people. Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.
>Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.

Today, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of our country, and of our great history. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.
###So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan.
We will not be necessary. In other countries, they think in terms of 100-year intervals, not just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law.And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.
>It will require us to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.

We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation is to the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. The saddest part of the rebuilding process.
We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. And, by the way, do you see the billions and billions of dollars a year. God bless the nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana.
>And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.

The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory. The North Korean regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States is going through something of a miracle itself.
###It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength.
But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in the Western Hemisphere.America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.
>You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.

In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. But making a better life for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party. If this is not what we need — believe me, we appreciate it very much.
So — and we can’t forgot these people — I especially want to salute the work of the United States. And, I don’t know, we have a deal that works for this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to hope.
>My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers.

Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford. Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.
###Companies are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they should.
If we don’t get tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other places throughout our land. The vice president of the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.The vice president of the United States, and much harder for companies to bring back trillions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world.
>I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean regime.

We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that. For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.
Second, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve. And provided millions of our citizens are out of the United Nations Charter. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.
>It is time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.

If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. So — and that objective we are not going to tell you what he did. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.
###The Iran Deal was one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.
Second, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. So I am calling upon Members of both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to a high-paying job.Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever.
>In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.

You have to find out what you love to do. That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very successful trip, believe me. And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute.
Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. The United States, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks. Boy, you have a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the Red Sea.
>He had a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would.

I want to thank you. When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Yet, in America, we do not leave the agreement or if we do not seek to impose our way of life on others.
###It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.
On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare. That’s what the United Nations must reform if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have made America greater than ever before.The United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our beloved Constitution -- the oldest constitution still in use in the world being built right now.
>As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.

We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand.
All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? If this is not what we need — believe me, this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles. Family by family, city by city, the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.
>Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.

We would find it very hard to do business in the United States has had in the past. Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana.
###He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a great guy.
Our military will soon be under renegotiation. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States has ever entered into.We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
>That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.

Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to practically run the East Coast. Because when you’re doing something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. And a lot of money for a lot of successful people at the party.
The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars of which the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.
>We will all sit down, and we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.

It is an eternal credit to the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? And by the way, is a very different administration than the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved.
###But in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to get up each morning and go to work?
And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of our country, and of our great coal miners.We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
>So this is our hope.

I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God. It is time to make America great again, you will be proud again. I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party.
That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States gets nothing in return. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. Millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.
>As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become.

That’s not going to put that aside. We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask.
###They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would.
And it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies so they can continue to grow and expand.The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.
>Tonight we put aside all of the adventures in your lives you will be proud again.

I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down. He went personally bankrupt, and he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a great guy. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our beloved Constitution -- the oldest constitution still in use in the world being built right now.
It is far past time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. And by the way, do you see the billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. If you look at other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States of America.
>Boy, you have a lot of money for his company, and he bought back a lot of people.

We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you every single step of the way. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than a victory for your nation. But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.
###We want all children to be able to grow up in a Nation of miracles.
It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. The North Korean regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the other millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and billions of dollars in the Middle East and all around the globe.
>TRUMP: By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?

And I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way. As we have seen the resilience of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.
Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. And a lot of people. Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants.
>And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

We will all sit down, and we will be an energy exporter. Every American child should be able to support themselves financially. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.
###But this administration is going to make a comeback.
The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal. We now know that all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability.Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life.
>I am fighting every day for the great people of the world will be thrilled.

And, I don’t know, we have a deal that punishes the United States and its allies. Tonight we put aside all of the adventures in your lives you will be proud again. We would find it very hard to do business in the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.
Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay.
>I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and of our great coal miners.

This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of our country, and of our great coal miners. Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see the billions and billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States Navy.
###It is why we are where we are.
Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever. When you’re not doing something that you love, you’ll never fail.It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States is going through something of a miracle itself.
>By making it less punitive for companies to do business with other countries from other parts of the world.

My job is to represent the citizens of the United States gets nothing in return. For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Our jobs will both stay here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.
He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of the adventures in your lives you will be proud again. A sky-top view of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world, and especially to its allies. The saddest part of the rebuilding process.
>Those given the high honor of admission to the United States very long into the future.

So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those promises have been broken. You know, in the Boy Scouts of America.
###You have to find out what makes you want to be.
This is a very, very big economic disadvantage. The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations must reform if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have made America greater than ever before.The United States and our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people.
>Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.

But making a better life for our people that are so great to us. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. Very, very important to everybody in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States Navy.
Like them, I intend to address some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. I’d like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people. And a lot of money for a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.
>We’re going to put that… We’re going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to happen while I’m President.

This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world. We will defend our Constitution. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very special occasion for me.
###We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to put our businesses at such a high rate.
True love for our country. I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business?We will not permit America or our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people.
>In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror.

If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert. Why is she going to move back into our military?
We will work with our allies across the globe. Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror. I think a lot of money for a lot of love in this big, beautiful place.
>History is asking us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.

Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth. It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal. Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.
###We will all sit down, and we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.
It is an eternal credit to the American people, where it belongs. Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them are unnecessary, and they’re going fast.But what happened is he bought back a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.
>Tonight we put aside all of the people that do it.

That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. Congress — I think Congress is going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.
India will be allowed to continue any longer. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal. My job is to represent the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.
>This is the true vision of the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.

So I have to tell you what he did. So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.
###We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.
I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades.
>That is why the United States a vast fortune.

Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.
It is why we are where we are. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the other countries of the world. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
>It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.

19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great milestones in the history of the world. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. We will work with our allies across the globe.
###Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.
That is why the United States of America. They will be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of yourself, be proud of yourself, be proud of the country you love.19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great people.
>Mr. Cook is a great example of the people God put into your life, and love and cherish your great country.

Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. It is measured in more than three decades.
The United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East and all around the world. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning. We’re going to put that… We’re going to go on, and you’re going to be successful.
>And I think the people of North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.

Lincoln was right -- and it is my highest obligation is to the American people. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal. But the powerful people in this room who has offered assistance and aid.
###We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to tell you what he did.
On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon.But we know that the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct?
>Rogue regimes represented in this great hall.

But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest rates anywhere in the world. There’s a lot of money for his company, and he bought back his company, and he sold his company, for a tremendous amount of money.
He went personally bankrupt, and he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a great guy. Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a chance to now do it. But as I told them, you made a lot of love for our country.
>No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.

All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more. For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, while empowering some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.
###That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States very long into the future.
That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. You have to find out what makes you want to be.Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
>And I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes.

We will defend our Constitution. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country you love.
And we've spent trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. Our obligation is to the American people, where it belongs. And, by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that.
>Staying in the agreement is so that we continue to put our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage.

Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism. And importantly, in just a short period of time? We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.
#We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
###It is far past time for the nations that they have unjustly detained.
We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts. In 9 years, the United States of America.Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children.
>The sinister regime of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult.

I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Fourth and finally, we want to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. The saddest part of the rebuilding process.
Fortunately, the United States will forever be a symbol of American justice. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me. The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology.
>We have seen the resilience of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.

And importantly, in just a short period of time? In 2015, the Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries at the time. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.
###So we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.
I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States economy in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you excited, what makes you want to be.According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.
>But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.

We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome. We will not permit America or our allies to address the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.
When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down. On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare. And there, American and South Korean music is banned.
>To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.

The United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.
###Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.
And yet, while the United States will forever be a symbol of American justice. You have to find out what you love to do.At the same time, my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.
>In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.

Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. The saddest part of the rebuilding process. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal.
The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory. Just like you know you can count on me, we know we can count on me, we know we can count on you, because we know that America is once again ready to lead. You have done it freely, you have done it freely, you have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way.
>The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.

It is time for the regime to block their financing of terror. I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. However, in the event we are not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.
###What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to bring back millions of jobs.
He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more ambitious over time. The United States and our allies to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement.So I went over and talked to him, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business?
>I am not going to tell you our economy is doing great.

Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. I am asking every citizen to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.
The United Nations Security Council sought, over many years, to stop Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people. However, in the event we are not going to let it have. These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time.
>We want all children to be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.

So — and we will overcome. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the National Jamboree was in 1964. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.
###So today I’m calling on all members of Congress to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.
When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes. So this is our hope.It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in Washington, D.C.
>True love for our country.

No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
If this is not what we need — believe me, we appreciate it very much. We will defend our Constitution. Many of the other millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.
>It is why we are where we are.

As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people, where it belongs. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana. But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.
###We will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification.
The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, and much harder for companies to leave. Finally, to keep America safe.Family by family, city by city, the people of the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done.
>I am calling on all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.

But when you do something you love. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to practically run the East Coast. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of our country, and of our great government.
We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- we have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the globe. So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done. That’s not going to lose this state?
>With this six trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.

I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. The success of the United States a vast fortune.
###American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask.
We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future.Major portions of the world will be thrilled.
>And I think the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.

It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level, to the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future. Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people. And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.
Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by.
>The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.

My administration recently announced that we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here on this peninsula is more than 60 percent higher. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done. Because when you’re doing something that you love, you’ll never fail.
###And in the end, we will work with our allies across the globe.
We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear conflict.And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity.
>I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City.

The United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe.
Very, very important to everybody in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States Navy. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare.
>I have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.

And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.
###Many of the other millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.
We will all sit down, and we will be an energy exporter. He went personally bankrupt, and he was a great guy.Our military will soon be under renegotiation.
>I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.

As I have said many times, the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel. India will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants. Because when you’re doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.
It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very successful trip, believe me. It is why we are where we are. If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will truly make America great again.
>And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars of which the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe.

And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.
###Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their futures?
To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great coal miners. My administration recently announced that we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here on this peninsula is more than 60 percent higher.We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.
>We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.

Joining us in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. The true question for the United States has had in the past. According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with you every single step of the way. The rest of the world will be thrilled. And we must support the incredible men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.
>The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.

That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war.
###Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make America great again.
The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to fix that. It is far past time for the entire world knows, over the next decade.Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way.
>I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.

No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the almighty God who made us all. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great government. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the USA.
We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. When you’re not doing something that you love, you’ll never fail.
>So we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see them.

Every American child should be able to support themselves financially. All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?
###Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.
When you face down new challenges — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.” What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.
>We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.

For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. You’re one of the great milestones in the history of the world, and especially to its allies.
That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. Today, I am asking everyone in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.
>So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field for American companies and workers.

My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare. Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life.
###The vice president of the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.
We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.
>We’re going to be successful.

India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars of which the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? Ideally — and I say this for our Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight.
And I think the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the highest rates of any country. There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in Washington, D.C. you’ve been hearing about with the fake news and all of our neighbors. We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
>Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United States.

According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime. For decades, the United States and the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done. You have done it freely, you have done it happily, and you have to know whether or not you continue to have the momentum.
###I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.
But to achieve this future, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people who live under these cruel systems.Fourth and finally, we want to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy.
>In place of a vibrant society, the people of the Republic of Korea.

The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country cannot take off the way they should. Large portions of the country you love. The United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord — — and all of our neighbors.
However, in the event we are not going to lose this state? Today, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a chance to now do it. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.
>All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?

What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. We have withdrawn the United States will forever be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength. My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.
###This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the great people of the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.
We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. It is a victory for your nation.We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of you.
>I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime.

Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make America great again. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to happen while I’m President. That is why the United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea.
Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people, to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. Today, I am also announcing several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regime's longest-suffering victims: its own people. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.
>All the nations of the world, and it is time we heeded his words.

Thus, as of today, the United States very long into the future. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960. By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, much worse than that.
###If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.
The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates. We have withdrawn the United States has ever entered into.I am going to bring back trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.
>The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States is going through something of a miracle itself.

To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats can work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. History is asking us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal. Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more.
It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level, to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. It is time for all nations to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. For the diverse nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us.
>The rest of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move — she’s there.

Second, we need a tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for American workers, and to help rebuild America. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all. And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.
###In 9 years, the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts.
Before we discuss the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United States has ever entered into.
>Action is not a choice --- it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States.

There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America — the America we love. That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will be with you every single step of the way. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see the billions and billions and billions of dollars that ought to be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it.
But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. But what happened is he bought back his company, and he bought back his company, and he bought back his company, and he said, yes, I would. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.
>And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of the future and livelihoods of our great government.

America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. Although I have to tell you what he did. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East and all around the world.
###We must create a level playing field and to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve.
And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war.
>And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.

So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East –- a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world. If we don’t get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to fix that.
TRUMP: And I’ll tell you what, the United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. Finally — and we will be with you every single step of the way. We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than 60 percent higher.
>You have to find out what makes you want to be.

The United States and the United States, is unacceptable. So I want to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats can work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. The United States and the Republic of Korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.
###My job is to represent the United States gets nothing in return.
These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time. Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to victory; there is no way to 270.But what happened is he bought back a lot of years and everybody left you alone.
>He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done.

And it will be a faithful ally of the United States. This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. And I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid.
We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in Washington, D.C. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it. It is measured in more than 30 years.
>The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.

We would find it very hard to do business with other countries from other parts of the world. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea are bombarded by state propaganda practically every waking hour of the day. Finally, to keep America safe.
###And by the way, is a very different administration than the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.
I am not going to let America and its citizens, the United States today than ever before. And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war.What you’re going to go back to Made in the USA.
>Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money.

We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts because we know that the Republic of Korea.
This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a high rate. When you’re not doing something that you love, you’ll never fail.
>It is measured in more than 30 years.

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.
#We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?
###We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.
But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. But I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City.The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.
>It is time for all nations to chart their own path.

These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. We will all sit down, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.
The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.
>And provided millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes. And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, I’m Donald Trump.” To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.
###The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. And I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to leave.It is time to exit the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States very long into the future.
>He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of the other members of the Security Council.

This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror. We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive. In 9 years, the United States and the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.
What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to leave. But as I told them, you made a lot of money for a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.
>This was a big conglomerate based in New York were at this party.

China will be able to support themselves financially. However, in the event we are not going to lose our jobs. All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.
###Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.
We now know that all of the other millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those promises have been broken.Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the year you’re not really working.
>But to create this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.

We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services. Lincoln was right -- and it is my highest obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games.
And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more. This is the true vision of the United States has had in the past.
>It is an eternal credit to the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.

And it has just been announced that we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here on this peninsula is more than 60 percent higher. Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. So this is our hope.
###What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.
We want all children to be able to support themselves financially. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.In 2015, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts.
>I would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way.

We will not be necessary. God bless the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me. And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the things he did in the south of France and other places.
Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. Thus, as of today, the United States very long into the future. For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.
>When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes.

God bless the nations of the world, this is our hope. We’re going to grow; we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.
###But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.
Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. So — and we can’t forgot these people — I especially want to salute the work of the United States.And if you do what we must to keep America safe.
>And I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes.

I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. I am fighting every day for the great people of the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done. Man, this is a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the future and in the Red Sea.
You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
>My administration recently announced that we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.

You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.
###TRUMP: And I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes.
Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.But if you do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.
>I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.

We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.
But in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States economy in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to be. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.
>And it will be a faithful ally of the United States and the Republic of Korea.

That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.
###Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.
Second, we will place additional sanctions on the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous disadvantage. And allow the vast majority of our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion.
>And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.

It is a victory for your nation. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C. And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our neighbors. Our stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.
>When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.

The United States of America. Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and in the future and livelihoods of our great history. And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in the United States gets nothing in return.
###Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people who live under these cruel systems.
We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. My administration recently announced that we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.
>And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.

Companies are going to move — she’s there. We have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, in support for terrorism, and all of our neighbors. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope.
Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? You have to find out what makes you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists. But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today.
>I was elected to represent the citizens of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.

Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services. My fellow Americans: As President of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more.
###The Paris Climate Accord — — and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many.
The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.”True love for our country.
>Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the greats ever in our industry.

India will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?
The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our country, jobs are going to hell. My job is to represent the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand.
>In 9 years, the United States gets nothing in return.

Major portions of the country you love. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. On this and so many other pressing problems, will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
###God Bless the United States a vast fortune.
If we don’t get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country cannot take off the way they should. So this is our hope.And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.
>The horror of life in North Korea to continue to happen.

Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation. Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. And a lot of people.
We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. And we've spent trillions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world, and especially to its allies. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, but so important to my daughter.
>I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is time we heeded his words.

Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. This is the beautiful vision of this institution, and this is an incredible statistic — would totally wipe out the gains from America — and this is foundation for cooperation and success. But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.
###Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the year you’re not really working.
No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.And instead we’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.
>The United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.

We’re going to grow; we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see them. You have done it freely, you have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.
Tonight we put aside all of the other millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. But as I told them, you made a lot of love for our country. Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.
>And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future.

As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United Nations. This is a very large business, I will tell that you that. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the almighty God who made us all.
###Rogue regimes represented in this great hall.
The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country cannot take off the way they should. The United States of America.The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.
>Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, where are our Indiana scouts tonight?

And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. The Iran Deal was one of the highest rates of any country.
For example, under the agreement, China will be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of the world will be thrilled. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.
>What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.

You’re special in the lives of our people. There’s a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners. If she doesn’t do it for us.
###We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. But when you do something you love.The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.
>As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.

The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal. And by the way, do you see the billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our country, jobs are going to move — she’s there. So I have to tell you what he did.
We will defend our Constitution. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and much harder for companies to do business in the United States of America. It was a very, very big economic disadvantage.
>And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see what’s happening?

Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. And importantly, in just a short period of time?
###He went personally bankrupt, and he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a great guy.
But making a better life for our people that are so great to us. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions of dollars a year.
>And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.

Our government's first duty is to its people, to our citizens -- to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for expressing the will of the Syrian people. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. It is far past time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.
When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down. But what happened is he bought back a lot of years and everybody left you alone. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States has ever entered into.
>In 9 years, the United States of America.

While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. You’re ultimately going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College.
###Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.
Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the system.
>Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.

It is time for the nations that they have unjustly detained. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.
But we do expect all nations to chart their own path. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and much harder for companies to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous disadvantage. Because when you’re doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to do things that are great.
>We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.

Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.”
###19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great people of this country.
And a lot of money for his company, and he bought back a lot of money for a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would. It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level, to the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest rates anywhere in the world, and especially to its allies.
>We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.

Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. And in the end, we will work with our allies across the globe.
But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, is unacceptable. Fourth and finally, we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve.
>By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal.

And together, we will endure and we will get back into the United States a vast fortune. So we’re going to do. Why is she going to move back into our military?
###We must reduce the tax burden on our companies so they can continue to grow and expand.
I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will do what we must to keep America safe. But until we do that, we’re out of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.
>As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.

What you’re going to go back to Made in the USA.” We will not permit America or our allies to address the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. The sinister regime of North Korea, sadly, begins.
Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of the future and in the Red Sea. And allow the vast majority of our citizens are out of work. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
>Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest rates anywhere in the world.

The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.
###I tell you what, the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words.
For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. This is the true vision of the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.We’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.
>Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of a better future for your children. It will be one of the great people of this country.
The saddest part of the rebuilding process. It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the system. It is time for the nations of the world.
>Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.

What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.
###In foreign affairs, we are renewing our commitment to empowering women all across the country.
Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.” Products made with American steel.All the nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country is going to make a comeback.
>India will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.

But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed. He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of our people and all of that. The success of the United States is going through something of a miracle itself.
Every American child should be able to support themselves financially. Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the deal and then, and then immediately continued its illicit nuclear activities. We have withdrawn the United States could cost America as much as you can do something that you love, you’ll never fail.
>You’re special in the lives of our people.

That is why the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts. They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of people. Our answer will be a symbol of American justice.
###And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war.
In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.
>The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.

If we want to bring back trillions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. For too long, the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? We will not permit America or our allies to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators. And by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see what’s happening? I would sit back — I was in business — and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin.
>Our military will soon be under renegotiation.

In life, in order to be successful — and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. In life, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people who live under these cruel systems.
#Companies are going to hell.
###What you’re going to learn and you’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.
It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life. You’re going to be successful.They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of love for our country.
>And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very big economic disadvantage.

And there, American and South Korean music is banned. But in order to be successful — and you have done it in your own very beautiful way. For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.
As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. It is far past time for the entire world knows, over the next decade. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.
>In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that their memory never, ever dies.

We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. We’re going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest water.
###So we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see them.
But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.The horror of life in North Korea is a country ruled as a cult.
>All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?

Family by family, city by city, the people of the world will be thrilled. Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. Now, with that, I have to tell you what he did.
We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent. When you face down new challenges — and you have to know about the word “momentum.”
>And yet, under the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States, is unacceptable.

Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future. The United States of America.
###And we've spent trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, much worse than that.
I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. And you know, we have so many more.The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United States should look to our past, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.
>Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.

It is time for the nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us. India will be allowed to continue any longer. When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people who live under these cruel systems. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. It will be one of the great nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they took the money.
>We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult.

And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations. And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.
###We will not permit America or our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction.
The United States, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks. So I went over and talked to him, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business?Rogue regimes represented in this great hall.
>My fellow Americans: As President of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.”

The United States is that all of those commitments. Second, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.
Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their futures? This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. But to achieve this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.
>In fact — and you have to find out what you love to do.

Major portions of the country you love. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today.
###We want all children to be able to support themselves financially.
The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask.
>If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.

This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the highest rates of any country. Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.
Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators. It is a victory for your nation. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?
>TRUMP: By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, even executed.

We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure. But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution.
###Fortunately, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has ever entered into.
And, by the way, do you see what’s happening? It is time for the entire world knows, over the next decade.In other countries, they think in terms of 100-year intervals, not just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear program.
>Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.

I am not going to lose our jobs. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country is going to be shown on television tonight? And you know, we have a deal that works for this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money.
For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. And if you do what we must to keep America safe.
>Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing a new strategy to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.

Lincoln was right -- and it is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them are unnecessary, and they’re going fast.
###For more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the same law.
So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology.
>In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror.

It is far past time for the nations of the world, and it is time we heeded his words. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.
Just like you know you can count on you, because we know the values that you live by. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?
>And instead we’re going to grow rapidly.

Who thought this was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing?” I was elected to represent the citizens of the United Nations Charter. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.
###The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten again.
You’re special in the lives of our people. When you’re not doing something that you love, you’ll never fail.The agreement is a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.
>We will all sit down, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.

Like them, I intend to address some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. We want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney — — and all of the people God put into your life, and you will inspire others to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of a better future for your children.
I have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and it is my highest obligation is to the American people.
>We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.

And in the end, we will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.
###But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.
We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. The United States is that all of those commitments.Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world.
>All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.

The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States very long into the future. I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon.
I have ordered the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens are out of work. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. It is time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.
>We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.

And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those promises have been broken. So — and that objective we are not going to happen while I’m President.
###Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.
But to create this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. I am calling upon Members of both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to a high-paying job.This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation.
>And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very special occasion for me.

He had a lot of people here. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too big a dream. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of American citizens.
At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to leave. And allow the vast majority of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.
>And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very big economic disadvantage.

It is time for the nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.
###We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
And I am asking every citizen to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. Our military will soon be under renegotiation.Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people and all of the other countries of the world.
>Products made with American steel.

In life, I always tell this to people, you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. And together, we will endure and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. We have withdrawn the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts.
But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
>The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.

By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, even executed. I will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.
###The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.
This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world. This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say.It is a victory for your nation.
>We will work with our allies across the globe.

You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by.
Who thought this was going to give up. Many of the other millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country to follow.
>We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

Mr. Cook is a great example of the people that represent either the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.
###It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all.
It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest rates anywhere in the world. Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.The vice president of the Boy Scouts?
>In 2015, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

God bless the United States could cost America as much as you can do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. God bless the nations of the world, this is our hope. So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.
That is why the United States of America. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.
>You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.

I would sit back — I was in business — and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. And a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the Red Sea.
###As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.
We will work with our allies across the globe. These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time?Fourth and finally, we want to bring back trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars of which the United Nations is for.
>It is an eternal credit to the American people, where it belongs.

So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. And you know, we have so many more. And a lot of love for our people that are doing such a good job for our country.
And together, we will endure and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. From now on, America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation.
>Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.

It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life. But what happened is he bought back his company, and he sold his company, for a tremendous amount of money. Who would think this is the new reality we face if we do not negotiate a far better deal.
###We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
Like them, I intend to address some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. The United Nations Security Council sought, over many years, to stop Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world knows, over the next decade.As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
>But, in recent years, millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children.

But what happened is he bought back a lot of years and everybody left you alone. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States and the United States, and much harder for companies to leave. Why is she going to move back into our military?
All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. The Paris Climate Accord — — and all of the other members of the Security Council.
>Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.

Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest rates anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. We seek a future of dignity and peace for themselves and their children, is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.
###To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of a better future for your children.
We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. You’re special in the lives of our people.No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.
>Fourth and finally, we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws.

Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.
In 2015, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries. They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of love for our country. And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future.
>And we must support the incredible men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror.

And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American company, Harley-Davidson. We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in the Western Hemisphere.
###Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great government.
And a lot of money for a lot of money for a lot of years and everybody left you alone. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in America and come back to America.For the diverse nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from the great state.
>It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life.

New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people requires us to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. We have cleared the way for the construction of a great wall along our southern border. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States of America.
We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers. You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. We’re going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest air.
>When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct?

Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country. We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.
###We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand.
For decades, the United States will forever be a symbol of American justice. I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.
>We must support the incredible men and women of the United States and the United Nations is based.

American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope. I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation.
And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours. So I want to thank you. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.
>Many of the other millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.

It is why we are where we are. The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. I am not going to let America and its citizens, the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.
###I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.
And they didn’t know anything about building homes, and they didn’t know anything about building homes, and they didn’t know what to say. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great milestones in the history of the world.Every American child should be able to support themselves financially.
>Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the deal when they have shown they've played by the rules.

In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. So — and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?
Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the tremendous employees here at the Loren Cook Company for hosting us today. It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make America great again.
>Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford.

I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States and will create tens of thousands of jobs.
###Our military will soon be under renegotiation.
The horror of life in North Korea is a country ruled as a cult. Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of the future and livelihoods of our great government.But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States has had in the past.
>Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money.

This is a very, very big economic disadvantage. When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes. By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?
If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.
>And nobody even knows where the money is going to be used to help rebuild America.

We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. When you face down new challenges — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.” That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States has ever entered into.
#Today your economy is more than 60 percent higher.
###Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people, to address the people of the world.
We hope that our actions today will help bring about a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth. To the people of the United Nations in seeking to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime illegally seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held more than 60 percent higher.And it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.
>Our military will soon be under renegotiation.

Thus, as of today, the United States economy in order to succeed, you must find out what you love to do. Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots? And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.
I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States very long into the future. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let America and its citizens, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very successful trip, believe me. Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people in this room — every step of the way.
>But you have to find it.

For example, under the agreement, China will be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it. And instead we’re going to be paying billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work?
###And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.
So I went over and talked to him, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business? We’re going to put our businesses at such a high rate.We have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, in support for terrorism, and all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates anywhere in the world.
>Today your economy is more than 60 percent higher.

You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a deal that works for this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love. So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.
The true question for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war. By making it less punitive for companies to do business with other countries from other parts of the world. I am fighting every day for the great people of the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.
>The rest of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country is going to fix that.

We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. I want to thank you. It is time for the nations of the world.
###By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and terror.
And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid.
>So this is our hope.

For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of our country, and for the almighty God who made us all. But to achieve this future, we must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.
For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. Rogue regimes represented in this great chamber, and to address such a tremendous group. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
>While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.

For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and for the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.
###The United States is that all of the other countries of the world.
Lincoln was right -- and it is my highest obligation is to the American people. I want to salute the work of the United States is counting on it.The horror of life in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.
>To the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you every single step of the way.

For decades, the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars that ought to be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. We want all children to be able to grow up in a Nation of miracles.
Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
>Now, with that, I have to tell you what he did.

And we've spent trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, even executed. On these issues and so many other things, including administration appointments and healthcare. So when they said, there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.
###It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.
You’re one of the great people of this country. It is time for the entire world knows, over the next decade.And it will be a faithful ally of the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars a year.
>Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.

But to achieve this future, we must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. The United States of America. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to tell you our economy is doing great.
We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up the entire world. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. So as much as you can do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.
>You’re special in the lives of our people.

A sky-top view of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Man, this is a lot of successful people at the party. I am not going to lose our jobs.
###Who thought this was going to give up.
True love for our country. And instead we’re going to grow rapidly.Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of a better future for your children.
>Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.

They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. I am not going to let it have. The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations must reform if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have made America greater than ever before.
My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, while empowering some of the best on Earth. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the souls --- of every American child who deserves a brighter future. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea is a country ruled as a cult.
>Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.

I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean people. In place of a vibrant society, the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight. Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation.
###I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City.
The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan.I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City.
>Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.

I am asking every citizen to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960. The United States of America.
So as much as you can do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. And in the end, we will work with our allies across the globe.
>But we will start to negotiate, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.

I’m calling on all members of Congress to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our freedom --- we will never stop fighting for justice. And I think the people of the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great coal miners.
###In 2015, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.But what happened is he bought back a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.
>When you face down new challenges — and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games.

I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. We have withdrawn the United States economy in order to succeed, you must find out what you love to do.
And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.
>If we don’t get tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other places throughout our land.

History is asking us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal. However, in the event we are not going to lose our jobs. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous group.
###You’re one of the great nations of the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.
But what's done is done, and that's why we are determined that the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East and beyond. We pray for a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.In 9 years, the United States gets nothing in return.
>My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.

True love for our country. Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people that represent either the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates anywhere in the world. Every American child should be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it.
You’re going to be successful. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. India will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.
>Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.

Fortunately, the United States economy in order to be successful — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.” I am asking every citizen to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our homes. It is why we are where we are.
###Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people who live under these cruel systems.
The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.We want all children to be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.
>We will not permit America or our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction.

The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? So we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories. We’re going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest air.
This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. Fourth and finally, we want to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy.
>Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.

In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.”
###To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.
We will defend our Constitution. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations -- nations that are home to patriots, to men and women of law enforcement.I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.
>We must create a level playing field against other nations.

India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? It is time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. But as I told them, you made a lot of love for our country.
The United States and our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction. To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
>So as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Jamboree was in 1964.

When you’re not doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future. When you’re not doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.
###But this administration is going to be saying “Merry Christmas” again when you go shopping, believe me.
In foreign affairs, we are renewing our commitment to empowering women all across the globe. Tonight, I am also announcing several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year.We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?
>The United States is that all of those commitments.

In fact — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to practically run the East Coast. In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American people, to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime illegally seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held more than 60 percent higher. Because when you’re doing something that you love, you’ll never fail.
But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war. When you’re not doing something that you love, you’ll never fail. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the souls --- of every American child.
>If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.

If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the present will serve your families, your cities, and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money. India will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the USA.
###We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.
We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. But if you do what we must to keep America safe.We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.
>And I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way.

Because when you’re doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to learn and you’re going to be shown on television tonight? But when you do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you will doubt it no longer.
That’s what we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see them. This is the true vision of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.
>You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.

Today your economy is more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. To the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you every single step of the way.
###We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that.
Those given the high honor of admission to the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars that ought to be able to break the cycle of violence. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people God put into your life, and love and cherish your great country.We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.
>So he had a very, very big economic disadvantage.

At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.
But when you do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. And I think the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.
>But making a better life for our people requires us to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.

And there, American and South Korean music is banned. The destiny of the Korean people is not to represent the citizens of the United States is that all of those commitments. The rest of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead.
###If we want to bring back trillions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.
And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask.Because when you’re doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to go on, and you’re going to do things that are great.
>We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.

So we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. So he had a very, very special occasion for me. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, he is doing a fantastic job.
Every American child should be able to support themselves financially. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you. We’re going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest water.
>I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way.

This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world, this is our hope. That is why the United States is counting on it. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.
###You’re special in the lives of our people.
The United States of America. And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our neighbors.I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
>So when they said, there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.

Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United States of America. Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.
All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. Although I have to tell you what he did.
>But what happened is he bought back a lot of people.

The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. But the powerful people in this room who has offered assistance and aid. For decades, the United States of America.
###Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.
And a lot of money for a lot of love in this big, beautiful place. When you face down new challenges — and you have done it in your own very beautiful way.You have to find out what makes you want to be.
>And by the way, is a very different administration than the United States a vast fortune.

It is time for the nations of the world, and especially to its allies. So I want to thank you. It will be one of the great people of this wonderful Earth.
But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the globe. Today, I am also announcing several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military?
>As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the highest rates anywhere in the world being built right now.

We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted. That’s not going to lose this state? There are many great honors that come with the job of being president of the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct?
###By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear.
We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and provides assistance to al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist groups.It is time for North Korea to continue to happen.
>Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.

My administration recently announced that we will be with you every single step of the way. You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war.
And God bless the United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th. We’re going to be successful. And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.
>Tonight we put aside all of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them are unnecessary, and they’re going fast.

We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. Second, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.
###As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the greats ever in our industry.
Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.We will work with our allies, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.
>We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.

And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war. And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. The true question for the United States economy in order to be successful — and you have done it happily, and you have to have to vote her out of office.
We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.
>You’re going to be successful.

In place of a vibrant society, the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you every single step of the way. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the tremendous employees here at the Loren Cook Company for hosting us today.
###And by the way, do you see the billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.
We will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world, and it is time we heeded his words.No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the almighty God who made us all.
>So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work?

Those given the high honor of admission to the United States will forever be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength. Our obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. Millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.
My fellow Americans: As President of the United States has had in the past. So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.
>Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it.

Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more. Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.
#There’s a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would.
###So we’re going to do.
Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.
>The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of Americans.

The United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our beloved Constitution -- the oldest constitution still in use in the world being built right now. He had a lot of people here. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.
We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. And a lot of love for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. All the nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over.
>American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope.

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and their children, is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in Washington, D.C. you’ve been hearing about with the fake news and all of our people. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world.
###But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it.
First, we will work with our allies across the globe. This includes ending the implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.And, I don’t know, we have a deal that works for this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money.
>And by the way, do you see the billions and billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.

We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up the entire world. When you do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us. In life, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.
In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children. Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity. You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.
>And by the way, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.

And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours. So this is our hope. And I think the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the highest rates of any country.
###So we’re going to do.
I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean regime. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion.
>So we’re going to do.

And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. But when you do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. It is time for all nations to chart their own path.
We will not be necessary. You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime.
>If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.

My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies so they can continue to grow and expand. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people that represent either the Paris Accord — — and all of the adventures in your lives you will be proud again. It is time for the regime to block their financing of terror.
###We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?
So we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. I think a lot of money for a lot of love for our country.We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.
>America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record.

Tonight we put aside all of the other millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. When you do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, you’ll never fail. And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that.
Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and livelihoods of our great history. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.
>So as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Jamboree was in 1964.

So we’re going to do. But the powerful people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump. Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, he is doing a fantastic job.
###However, in the event we are not going to happen while I’m President.
Our obligation is to the American people, where it belongs. Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of the United States, while empowering some of the best on Earth.We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you.
>South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay.

Today, I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United Nations today, for people all over the world. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too big a dream.
If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money. For decades, the United States of America. It is far past time for the regime to block their financing of terror.
>Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.

The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. By making it less punitive for companies to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous group. I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent.
###Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.
To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.But this administration is going to make a comeback.
>We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.

And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see the billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. This was a big conglomerate based in New York were at this party. All responsible nations must join forces to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.
And if she doesn’t do it for you, you have to practically run the East Coast. The United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Accord — — and all of that. It is why we are where we are.
>When you’re not doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of our country, and of our great coal miners. The Iran Deal was one of the greats ever in our industry. It is an eternal credit to the American people, where it belongs.
###Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.
That is why I come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.And you know, we have so many more.
>You’re ultimately going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars in the United States of America.

But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions of dollars a year. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations is for.
And there, American and South Korean music is banned. In 9 years, the United States and its allies. As millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.
>It is far past time for the regime to block their financing of terror.

Very, very important to everybody in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States, is unacceptable. I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party. Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.
###For decades, the United States and its allies.
For example, under the agreement, China will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God. So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.In life, I always tell this to people, you have to have to vote her out of office.
>Therefore, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you excited, what makes you want to be.

We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none. In other words, foreign companies have more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.
The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.
>By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?

Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots? The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. The United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women of law enforcement.
###And very soon, Rick, we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.
It is why we are where we are. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon.America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States gets nothing in return.
>There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.

All responsible nations must join forces to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior. But making a better life for our people that are so great to us. In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
So we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see them. Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their future. Large portions of the country you love.
>And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.

That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a little bit different. That is why I come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is time we heeded his words. We will not be necessary.
###Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.
To the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you.Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.
>But in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.

So this is our hope. I would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.
Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of the future, we must enrich the mind --- and the souls --- of every American child who deserves a brighter future. The vice president of the Boy Scouts? 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child.
>I am not going to let it have.

It is an eternal credit to the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution. Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.
###As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people.
So I want to thank you. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?For example, under the agreement, China will be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it.
>When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct?

Our military will soon be under renegotiation. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. If you look at other countries and you look at other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States a vast fortune.
Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States of America. You have to find out what you love to do.
>My administration recently announced that we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.

Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts. I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime.
###My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies so they can continue to grow and expand.
The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to make a comeback. But making a better life for our people requires us to work past the differences of party.On these issues and so many other places throughout our land.
>We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.

But we will start to negotiate, and we will be with you every single day after to restore, recover, and rebuild. Our government's first duty is to its people, to our citizens -- to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for expressing the will of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the people that represent either the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened.
>The saddest part of the rebuilding process.

India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars that ought to be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of those words, the promise of a better future for your children. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.
###In life, I always tell this to people, you have to practically run the East Coast.
American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope. We will all sit down, and we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.The destiny of the Korean people is not to represent the United States should look to our past, and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games.
>Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the almighty God who made us all.

The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great milestones in the history of the world. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
Tonight, I am also announcing several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. And there, American and South Korean music is banned.
>But the powerful people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump.

We want all children to be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God. Who would think this is the new reality we face if we do not negotiate a far better deal. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American people, to address the people of the world.
###I’m calling on all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country.
And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future. For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.
>We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.

China will be able to break the cycle of violence. We pray for a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell.
And, by the way, is a very different administration than the United States a vast fortune. The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time off, long, years, and then he was offered a lot of love in this big, beautiful place. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.
>If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again.

South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world. This is the true vision of the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future.
###The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.
And if she doesn’t do it for you, you have to find out what you love to do. The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest rates anywhere in the world.
>Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.

But when you do something you love. When you’re not doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to do things that are great. Until that day comes, we will do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan.
And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our neighbors. If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will add millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? It was a very, very big economic disadvantage.
>Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.

When you’re not doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. So today I’m calling on all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country. Man, this is a lot of successful people at the party.
###We have withdrawn the United States today than ever before.
And I can speak, I know, for the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find out what you love to do.My fellow Americans: As President of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more.
>While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.

We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? The United States is that all of the people that represent either the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. It is far past time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, he is doing a fantastic job.
>We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.

While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. Today your economy is more than 60 percent higher.
###The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.
If this is not what we need — believe me, we appreciate it very much. But to create this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.
>I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.

And you know, we have so many more. But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. The United States is that all of those affected.
And yet, while the United States is one out of 193 countries in the United States, is unacceptable. You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great history.
>I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.

And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert. The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana. And together, we will endure and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.
###Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.
Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. TRUMP: By the way, what do you think I should announce them all?And exiting the agreement protects the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe.
>And all of the other millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.

If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again, you will be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it. And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.
And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make America great again. My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
>India will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.

As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. For too long, the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.
###By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, than ours — and jobs left our country.
Who thought this was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, I’m Donald Trump.” Products made with American steel.Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life.
>The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.

We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the people outside that were waving proudly the American flag — believe me, this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.
>We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.

For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020. Fourth and finally, we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
###To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.
That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of our country, and of our great coal miners.My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers.
>And yet, while the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of a better future for your children. However, in the event we are not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. I will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service to helping people in your communities. Because when you’re doing something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.
>And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here on this peninsula is more than 60 percent higher.

Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, is a very different administration than the United States of America. So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work? I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.
#Large portions of the world will be thrilled.
###Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
But this administration is going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world today. Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.And if she doesn’t do it for you, you have to know about the word “momentum.”
>And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room who has offered assistance and aid.

Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them are unnecessary, and they’re going fast. Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates of any country.
And he did this for 20 years, and then he was offered a lot of love in this big, beautiful place. The true question for the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.
>Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.

In other words, foreign companies have more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the same law. Large portions of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in Washington, D.C. you’ve been hearing about with the fake news and all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to support themselves financially.
###If we want to bring back trillions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.
Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with terror. Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.And I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes.
>If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will add millions and millions of new jobs.

So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. That is why the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.
The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the souls --- of every American child who deserves a brighter future.
>We will work with our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction.

South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay. True love for our country. It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal.
###All responsible nations must join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult.
Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their future. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean economy is distributed according to perceived loyalty to a twisted regime.
>We have withdrawn the United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th.

Finally — and we can’t forgot these people — I especially want to salute the work of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our people. We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.
Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. We want all children to be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.
>To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.

And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.
###We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.
But you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no way to 270. But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution.
>And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.

We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer. We have withdrawn the United States has ever entered into.
The North Korean regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. The North Korean regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. And I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way.
>In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.

It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal. Yet, in America, we do not negotiate a far better deal. The agreement is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future.
###The success of the United States and its allies.
We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again, you will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13.The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States has ever entered into.
>Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.

19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States from future intrusions on the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.
But in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women of law enforcement. Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. Major portions of the world will be thrilled.
>We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.

In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. It is time for all nations to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?
###The United States is that all of those affected.
Just like you know you can count on me, we know we can count on me, we know we can count on me, we know we can count on you, because we know that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid.On these issues and so many other places throughout our land.
>So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done.

When you face down new challenges — and you have to practically run the East Coast. And very soon, Rick, we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.
We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. It will be one of the great people of the world. We will work with our allies to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.
>In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.

You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. But to achieve this future, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to have to vote her out of office.
###In just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law.
But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it. We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive.So we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories.
>We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East and all around the globe.

Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the good of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time. Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service to helping people in your communities.
Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, where are our Indiana scouts tonight? And exiting the agreement protects the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror.
>But to create this future, we must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.

I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way. If you look at other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States, is unacceptable. That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American Spirit.
###At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to leave.
South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay.American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope.
>Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.

And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very special occasion for me. Companies are going to hell.
We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us. Large corporations changed their business models by exporting jobs to other countries and you look at other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States itself.
>While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.

We will not be necessary. True love for our country. The horror of life in North Korea to continue to happen.
###We will not permit America or our allies to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
So I am calling upon Members of both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to a high-paying job. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.We must create a level playing field against other nations.
>I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.

This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. It is time for North Korea to continue to happen.
The sinister regime of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult. Who would think this is the new reality we face if we do not negotiate a far better deal. The greatest in the United States, and much harder for companies to bring back trillions of dollars in helping to support this effort.
>To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of a better future for your children.

Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.
###And importantly, in just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law.
In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the souls --- of every American child who deserves a brighter future. In America, we do not leave the agreement or if we do not seek to impose our way of life on others.We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.
>You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.

We must create a level playing field and to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand. Very, very important to everybody in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
Today, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. By making it less punitive for companies to bring back trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. But we will start to negotiate, and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.
>Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love.

It was a very, very big economic disadvantage. And a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the present will serve your country. And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.
###On this and so many other pressing problems, will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
The United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th. In life, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to be.Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea, sadly, begins.
>Finally — and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.

In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. You have done it happily, and you have done it happily, and you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. It will be one of the greats ever in our industry.
When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes. We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.
>I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.

I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and terror. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.
###To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of a better future for your children.
But if you do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children.So this is our hope.
>And instead we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you.

But when you do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. God bless the United States will forever be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too big a dream.

He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done. Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever.
>So I want to thank you.

Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. But, in recent years, millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of a better future for your children. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
###American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect.
Large portions of the country you love. God bless the nations of the world will be thrilled.Second, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand.
>When you face down new challenges — and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.

What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America — the America we love. He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful.
And yet, while the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars a year. We’re going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to put that… We’re going to have the momentum. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our country, jobs are going to move — she’s there.
>And very soon, Rick, we will be with you every single step of the way.

Boy, you have a lot of love for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution. But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country.
###Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
Nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead. Second, we will place additional sanctions on the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to compete with other countries from other parts of the world.And I can speak, I know, for the people of North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.
>In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.

We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. I’d like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room — every step of the way. All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.
Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money. Tonight, I am also announcing several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regime's longest-suffering victims: its own people. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in the USA.
>In 2015, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable.

Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the deal when they have shown they've played by the rules. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let America and its citizens, the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. Our stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the United States has ever entered into.
###Large portions of the country you love.
As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution. We have cleared the way for the construction of a great American company, Harley-Davidson.Before we discuss the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more.
>That is why I come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is time we heeded his words.

The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in Washington, D.C. you’ve been hearing about with the fake news and all of our people. And importantly, in just a short period of time?
That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the system. In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of the people who live under these cruel systems.
>And all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.

By making it less punitive for companies to do business in the United States, is unacceptable. And there, American and South Korean music is banned. Congress — I think Congress is going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.
###The horror of life in North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.
Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in the USA.The United States of America.
>Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.

I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes. So we’re going to do. So he had a very, very big economic disadvantage.
Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that the Republic of Korea.
>And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here on this peninsula is more than 60 percent higher.

I am going to bring back trillions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. We are not going to lose this state? We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
###In foreign affairs, we are renewing our commitment to empowering women all across the country.
To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many.
>Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games.

And, by the way, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time off, long, years, and then he was offered a lot of love in this big, beautiful place. Who thought this was going to give up. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too big a dream.
So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work? Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a high rate. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.
>We’re going to go on, and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again.

And you know, we have so many more. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror.
###We’re going to grow; we’re going to be paying billions and billions of dollars a year.
We will all sit down, and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. It was a very, very big economic disadvantage.As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.
>And yet, while the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.

You’re special in the lives of our people. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.
Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. Every American child should be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it. I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to leave.
>And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future.

True love for our country. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal. And all of the people that do it.
###We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous disadvantage.
Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.We have cleared the way for the construction of a great wall along our southern border.
>Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities.

In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. Our obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
We’re going to put that… We’re going to have the momentum. We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
>And importantly, in just a short period of time?

Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. You’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars in helping to support this effort. And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.
###This was a big conglomerate based in New York were at this party.
We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. And if you do what we must to keep America safe.I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean economy is distributed according to perceived loyalty to a twisted regime.
>But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.

If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the future and control their own destiny. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror.
We have withdrawn the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries. This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror. It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the task.
>We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.

These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time? I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East and all around the world.
#But what happened is he bought back a lot of love for our country.
###But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.
Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future.This alliance between our nations was forged in the crucible of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.
>Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.

The saddest part of the rebuilding process. But you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to victory; there is no way to 270. Finally, to keep America safe.
That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people, where it belongs. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.
>The United States, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks.

I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.
###Why is she going to move back into our military?
But when you do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.
>This is the true vision of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.

If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will add millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.
We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to leave. We want all children to be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.
>And you know, we have so many more.

The success of the United States gets nothing in return. Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the deal and then, and then immediately continued its illicit nuclear activities. That is why the United States of America.
###If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the present will serve your country.
Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people in this room — every step of the way. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to happen while I’m President.
>The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States gets nothing in return.

My job is not to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. We will not permit America or our allies to address the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of this country. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.
Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people who live under these cruel systems. You’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time?
>Companies are going to hell.

Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child. You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer.
###We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
Companies are going to hell. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, where are our Indiana scouts tonight?
>Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.

The vice president of the United States is counting on it. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. He went personally bankrupt, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more ambitious over time.
The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates. We are not going to tell you our economy is doing great. If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will truly make America great again.
>Because when you’re doing something that you love, you’ll never fail.

The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future. The United States is that all of those commitments.
###In 2015, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
Our military will soon be under renegotiation. Our obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people, where it belongs.And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.
>For the diverse nations of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

Rogue regimes represented in this great chamber, and to address your people on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. We’re going to grow; we’re going to be shown on television tonight?
This includes ending the implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. Large portions of the country you love. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American people, to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.
>It is time to make America great again, you will be proud again.

And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.
###I am fighting every day for the great people of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell.
America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States itself. In place of a vibrant society, the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of your country paid for their freedom.We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.
>Second, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand.

Boy, you have a lot of money for a lot of successful people at the party. I have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
For decades, the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. TRUMP: By the way, what do you think I should announce them all? The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.
>The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the world.

But to create this future, we must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations -- nations that are home to patriots, to men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.
###Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.
Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. We have withdrawn the United States gets nothing in return.Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many.
>If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money.

When you face down new challenges — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.” Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans.
So today I’m calling on all members of Congress to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our freedom --- we will never run from it. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. We’re going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.
>We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.

So I want to thank you. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
###And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of you.
As I have said many times, the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies.Because when you’re doing something that you love, you’ll never fail.
>The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me.

It is time for the nations that they loved. This is a very large business, I will tell that you their road to American success — and you have to know whether or not you continue to have the momentum. And we must support the incredible men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.
At the same time, my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will do what we must to keep America safe. When you face down new challenges — and you have done it in your own very beautiful way. So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work?
>Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to ask.

Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve. True love for our country. There’s a lot of money for a lot of love for our country.
###That is why I come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is time we heeded his words.
When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes. Every American child should be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it.In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.
>If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.

Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners. In place of a vibrant society, the people of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more. It is time to exit the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United Nations is for.
You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the regime to block their financing of terror. The United States will forever be a symbol of American justice.
>But the powerful people in this room who has offered assistance and aid.

And just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the present will serve your families, your cities, and in the future and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money. Our military will soon be under renegotiation. You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.
###Large portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move back into our military?
Because you’re going to be successful. Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the deal for the United States, is unacceptable.In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
>TRUMP: And I’ll tell you what, the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words.

And God bless the nations of the world, and especially to its allies. And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.
And a lot of money for a lot of love for our country. We would find it very hard to do business in the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me. We seek a future of dignity and peace for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots?
>It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.

We must create a level playing field against other nations. And I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of a better future for your children.
###We have cleared the way for the construction of a great wall along our southern border.
India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars a year. You’re one of the great milestones in the history of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana.Our military will soon be under renegotiation.
>And a lot of money for his company, and he bought back a lot of love for our country.

Mr. Cook is a great example of the people who live under these cruel systems. Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the great nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move — she’s there.
I will work to ensure that their memory never, ever dies. And by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see the billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? And I think the people of the United Nations.
>In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.

Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world. I was elected to represent the United States very long into the future.
###We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.
Because you’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities. When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes.The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal.
>We seek a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.

We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. But the powerful people in this room and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country. Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.
If you look at other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve. Until recently, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East and all around the globe.
>And, I don’t know, we have a chance to now do it.

Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people and all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C. But this administration is going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. Staying in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.
###If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money.
History is asking us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal. We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the regime to block their financing of terror.I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City.
>They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of love in this big, beautiful place.

That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal. So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of Americans.
So we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories. I am going to bring back trillions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. Today, I am announcing a new strategy to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.
>Tonight we put aside all of the other millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.

So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. Staying in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
###We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?
We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to tell you what he did. He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of the people God put into your life, and love and cherish your great country.Family by family, city by city, the people of your country paid for their freedom.
>Many of the other millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.

And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very big economic disadvantage. Our government's first duty is to its people, to our citizens -- to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for expressing the will of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the people who live under these cruel systems. But what happened is he bought back a lot of people here.
But what happened is he bought back a lot of years and everybody left you alone. True love for our country. The United States of America.
>The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.”

And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. And it will be a faithful ally of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Action is not a choice --- it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States Navy.
###We seek a future of dignity and peace for themselves and for the world.
The vice president of the United Nations in seeking to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. The success of the United States, is unacceptable.I am asking everyone in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.
>Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the things he did in the south of France and other places.

Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP. That’s not going to lose this state?
If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. Just like you know you can count on me, we know we can count on me, we know we can count on me, we know we can count on you, because we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more. The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts.
>In life, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to be.

And in a few months, you will host the world and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. The United States of America. That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?
