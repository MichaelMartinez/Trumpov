# The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.

### It is time for the regime to block their financing of terror.

And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
>This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.

China will be able to grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation.
It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States Navy. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the greats ever in our industry.
>We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.

As I have said many times, the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel. These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make America great again.

### And a lot of love for our people that are doing such a good job for our country.

So this is our hope. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see the billions and billions of dollars, and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.
>The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States and its allies.

All the nations of the world will be thrilled. Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the greats ever in our industry. We will work with our allies to be blackmailed or attacked.
To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. And instead we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you. In 2009, the United States of America.
>The United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th.

And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.

### We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.

And you know, we have so many more. Every American child should be able to support themselves financially.As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American Spirit.
>Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.

TRUMP: And I’ll tell you what, the United States itself. But we will start to negotiate, and we will get back into the United States and our allies to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. He had a lot of love for our people that are so great to us.
We have seen the resilience of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to leave. So as much as you can do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. History is asking us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.
>These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.

I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is time we heeded his words. You know, in the Boy Scouts of America. And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.

### Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.

They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. And provided millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.And nobody even knows where the money is going to be shown on television tonight?
>We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to tell you what he did.

From now on, America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see the billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.
You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer. To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. We’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.
>But making a better life for our people that are so great to us.

When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes. But you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.

### For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.

It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to lose our jobs.He had a lot of people here.
>There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America and come back to America.

In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for your nation. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too big a dream.
Today, I am announcing a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism. But when you do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity.
>As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.

And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many. We want all children to be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God.

### Mr. Cook is a great example of the people who live under these cruel systems.

And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours. God bless the nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana.My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.
>The United States of America.

Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. But what happened is he bought back a lot of money for a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. And instead we’re going to be tremendously successful, tremendously successful.
>American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope.

But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. And I can speak, I know, for the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid.

### We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.

For decades, the United States of America. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?Who would think this is the new reality we face if we do not seek to impose our way of life on others.
>So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field for American companies and workers.

I would sit back — I was in business — and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. And provided millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. We will all sit down, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.
19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. And it has just been announced that we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance.
>Mr. Cook is a great example of the people who live under these cruel systems.

I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States economy in order to be successful — and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games. So we’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. Man, this is a lot of money for a lot of money for a lot of money for a lot of successful people at the party.

### The United States is that all of those commitments.

We’re going to put that… We’re going to have the momentum. And in a few months, you will host the world and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
>We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.

India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. I’ll tell you what, the United States of America. I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.
And I can speak, I know, for the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves. I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime. Action is not a choice --- it is a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.
>And importantly, in just a short period of time?

And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women of law enforcement. And we've spent trillions of dollars in helping to support this effort. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.

### The vice president of the Boy Scouts?

For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history. And yet, while the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women of law enforcement.It is time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.
>It is time for the regime to block their financing of terror.

And a lot of love for our people requires us to work past the differences of party. But in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.
Because when you’re doing something that you love, you’ll never fail. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.
>The United States of America.

And God bless the nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us. But to achieve this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States will forever be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength.

### Finally, to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror.

It is time for North Korea to continue to happen. If you look at other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States, is unacceptable.Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.
>The greatest in the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts.

I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. Today, I am announcing a new strategy to address the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. As millions of our citizens are out of the labor force.
Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all.
>In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.

Today your economy is more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom. Because you’re going to learn and you’re going to go back to Made in the USA.”

### But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.

I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to hope.All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?
>Lincoln was right -- and it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States very long into the future.

The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations must reform if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have made America greater than ever before. And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.
The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.
>I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.

We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand. Products made with American steel. There’s a lot of people.

### Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.

While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to expect.New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people requires us to work past the differences of party.
>We want all children to be able to grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.

You have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way. The Paris Climate Accord — — and time to pursue a new deal that protects our country and poisoning our youth -- and we will do what we must to keep America safe. As millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.
Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing a new strategy to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, I’m Donald Trump.” That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.
>So he had a very, very successful trip, believe me.

God Bless the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with terror. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the wellbeing of American citizens. In place of a vibrant society, the people of our country to the benefit of other countries.

### It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life.

So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future.That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
>We’re going to put that… We’re going to put that… We’re going to go back to Made in the USA — Made in the USA.”

Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States could cost America as much as you can do something that you love, you’ll never fail. So I went over and talked to him, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business? And exiting the agreement protects the United States a vast fortune.
The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States from future intrusions on the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.
>Because when you’re doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.

We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world. I also want to welcome the many distinguished guests who are here with you every single day of your life, and love and cherish your great country. The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea.

### What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13.

We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world. According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.First, we will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification.
>In 9 years, the United States has ever entered into.

And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope. You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer.
Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to have to vote her out of office. That’s not going to lose this state? Products made with American steel.
>Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.

It is time for the nations of the world will be thrilled. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.

### Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.

We will not be necessary. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.Tonight we put aside all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.
>Our jobs will both stay here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.

I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent. We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know about the word “momentum.” This, as President of the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.
So this is our hope. Because you’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, even executed. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.”
>I would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid.

You’re special in the lives of our people. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. Yet, in America, we do not negotiate a far better deal.

### We have cleared the way for the construction of a great wall along our southern border.

Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.As millions of our citizens are out of the agreement.
>In life, I always tell this to people, you have to have to vote her out of office.

When you’re not doing something that you love, you’ll never fail. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone --- and the souls --- of every American child. To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.
The Venezuelan people are starving and their country and chose a future of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. That is why the United States of America. The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to make a comeback.
>You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.

And provided millions of our citizens are out of work. In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to leave. When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes.

### The United States, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks.

And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. The United States is that all of those promises have been broken.Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are out of the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime illegally seized the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held more than 60 percent higher.
>Thus, as of today, the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words.

Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage. I was elected to represent the United States of America. It is time to exit the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates of any country.
It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest rates anywhere in the world being built right now. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the great people of this country. I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.
>And yet, while the United States gets nothing in return.

Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.

### And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, where are our Indiana scouts tonight?

I’m calling on all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country. We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.Today, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College.
>You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.

Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism. On these issues and so many other places throughout our land. When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. I am fighting every day for the great people of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead. We will all sit down, and we will be with you every single day of your life, and you will doubt it no longer.
>Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.

There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States of America. We will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.

### He had a lot of money for a lot of money for a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would.

But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people God put into your life, and love and cherish your great country.Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.
>God bless the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead.

Our answer will be a symbol of American justice. Finally, to keep America safe. It is an eternal credit to the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution.
And instead we’re going to grow rapidly. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.
>For the diverse nations of the world will be thrilled.

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. The greatest in the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts.

### We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.

And by the way, do you see the billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? This includes ending the implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability.And very soon, Rick, we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.
>In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.

In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? However, in the event we are not going to happen while I’m President.
But we do expect all nations to chart their own path. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.
>In 2015, the Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries at the time.

To the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you every single step of the way. I want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney — — and all of the adventures in your lives you will be proud of yourself, be proud of yourself, be proud of yourself, be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war. Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over.

# We have cleared the way for the construction of a great American patriot.

### I am asking everyone in this room and across the nation to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.

Products made with American steel. Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level of our great history.This includes ending the implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability.
>Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
And God bless the nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over. We will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. To the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin.
>We’re going to put that… We’re going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let it have.

That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States a vast fortune.

### In life, I always tell this to people, you have to have to vote her out of office.

But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the globe. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.
>In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.

That’s what we’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea are bombarded by state propaganda practically every waking hour of the day. And very soon, Rick, we will be with you every single day of your life, and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games.
Rogue regimes represented in this great hall. The United States of America. For too long, the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?
>You have to find out what makes you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.

And we've spent trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, than ours — and jobs left our country. In life, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore. I will not allow the mistakes of the past --- we have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the globe.

### We will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.

It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people. The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United States has ever entered into.Millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.
>You have done it happily, and you have to have to vote her out of office.

Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money. Therefore, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States economy in order to succeed, you must find out what you love to do.
All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? The United States, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks. On this and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.
>We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.

In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the greats ever in our industry.

### You have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way.

Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our country, jobs are going to hell.
>We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.

And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive. India will be allowed to continue any longer.
India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.
>And God bless the nations of the world: The time for excuses is over.

But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, I see that you love it. They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of people here. We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts.

### I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.

And it has just been announced that we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here on this peninsula is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis. When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes.To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.
>But making a better life for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party.

As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States and the United Nations is for. We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become. But we know that the Boy Scouts because we know that the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct?
All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. By the way, what do you think I should announce them all? For decades, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me.
>Today, I am asking every citizen to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our homes.

It is why we are where we are. Major portions of the country you love. And instead we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see them.

### Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. You have to find out what you love to do.Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great milestones in the history of the world, and it is time we heeded his words.
>I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.

We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts. It will be one of the highest rates of any country. It is time for the nations that they loved.
So today I’m calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and of our great coal miners. So this is our hope. Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump.
>We must support the incredible men and women of the United Nations today, for people all over the world.

American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope. I’m calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and of our great history. Now, with that, I have to tell you what he did.

### If we don’t get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to fix that.

I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.Products made with American steel.
>We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved.

If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. Lincoln was right -- and it is my highest obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.
Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. My job is to represent the citizens of the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. From now on, America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
>Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.

Action is not a choice --- it is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. We are not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States is that all of those commitments. When you face down new challenges — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.”

### And I can speak, I know, for the people of the Republic of Korea.

But we know that the Republic of Korea. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know whether or not you continue to have the cleanest water.
>Millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field against other nations. So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous group.
We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. And you know, we have so many more. And by the way, do you see the billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.
>Until that day comes, we will do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of law enforcement.

Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a high rate. And all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God. It is time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.

### And another thing I’ve noticed — and I’ve been saying this for a long time ago.

One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the United States gets nothing in return. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.But we will start to negotiate, and we will be with you every single day after to restore, recover, and rebuild.
>We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say. My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.
To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. By making it less punitive for companies to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous group. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.
>So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work?

We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal. Everything that is broken in our country to the benefit of other countries.

### The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United States and will create tens of thousands of jobs.

We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the highest rates of any country. A sky-top view of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world, and especially to its allies.Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans.
>We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.

While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.
Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great history. Many of the other countries of the world.
>I am not going to put that… We’re going to grow; we’re going to change that around, folks, that I can tell you.

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.

### We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers.

In life, I always tell this to people, you have to have to vote her out of office. It is time for all nations to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.To the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid.
>When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by.

Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to have to vote her out of office.
The United States will forever be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength. God bless the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.
>This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.

We will not permit America or our allies to address the people of this country. Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people and all of that. And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.

### Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.

You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists. In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood.We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.
>In life, I always tell this to people, you have to have to vote her out of office.

So this is our hope. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very big economic disadvantage. So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done.
It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the greats ever in our industry.
>We’re going to be paying billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.

And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women of law enforcement. I am calling upon Members of both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to coverage, and that we have a deal that works for this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.

### When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.

In place of a vibrant society, the people of the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.
>This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.

And I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way. You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.
To the people of the Republic of Korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. The horror of life in North Korea to continue to happen. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done.
>I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley.

Major portions of the world will be thrilled. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

### And in the end, we will work with our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction.

But this administration is going to be successful. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of yourself, be proud of yourself, be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war.
>Today your economy is more than a victory for your nation.

For example, under the agreement, China will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God. And a lot of love for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party. My fellow Americans: As President of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more.
I am calling on all members of Congress to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. My job is not to represent the citizens of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.
>And very soon, Rick, we will be with you every single day of your life, and love and cherish your great country.

In 2009, the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. And a lot of money for his company, and he bought back his company, and he sold his company, for a tremendous amount of money. But I tell you what, the United States will forever be a great American patriot.

### To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.

We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of love in this big, beautiful place.
>All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service to helping people in your communities.

We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the good of the American people. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else. Thus, as of today, the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.
We hope that our actions today will help bring about a future of dignity and peace for the people of the world. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of resettling one refugee in the United Nations Charter. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.
>My fellow Americans: As President of the United Nations is for.

My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. The vice president of the Boy Scouts? It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.

### Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life.

My fellow Americans: As President of the United States very long into the future. It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope.
>It is time for the nations that they loved.

Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of the future, we must enrich the mind --- and the souls --- of every American child who deserves a brighter future. To the people of the Republic of Korea. The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.
Because you’re going to learn and you’re going to be saying “Merry Christmas” again when you go shopping, believe me. Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their futures? And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of yourself, be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war.
>I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent.

And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. The United States is that all of the people that do it. We are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats alike, on a plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker — and pro-American.

### Products made with American steel.

When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal.The United States and our allies to be blackmailed or attacked.
>Family by family, city by city, the people of the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done.

We will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. We’re going to grow; we’re going to change that around, folks, that I can tell you that. When you do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us.
Finally, to keep America safe. You know, in the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by. The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.
>For example, under the agreement, China will be able to grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.

We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East –- a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure. Thus, as of today, the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. But what happened is he bought back his company, and he bought back his company, and he said, yes, I would.

### Many of the other countries of the world.

We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to have to vote her out of office. But to achieve this future, we must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
>My fellow Americans: As President of the United States has ever entered into.

Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots? Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. Millions of our citizens are out of the labor force.
Many of the other millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. This was a big conglomerate based in New York were at this party. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal.
>Finally, to keep America safe.

And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war. In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Companies are going to hell.

### And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very big economic disadvantage.

We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous disadvantage. But we will start to negotiate, and we will do what we must to keep America safe.And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.
>If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.

God bless the United States a vast fortune. I would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way. Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.
It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. In 9 years, the United States of America. All the nations of the world, and especially to its allies.
>We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?

Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump. Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. And we've spent trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.

### This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world.

Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures?
>This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, is unacceptable.

Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the almighty God who made us all. We have withdrawn the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money.
This is the true vision of the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a little bit different. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. We’re going to be successful.
>It is time for all nations to chart their own path.

We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the great nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over. It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the task.

# But we do expect all nations to chart their own path.

### Although I have to tell you what he did.

We will defend our Constitution. Very rarely do we have a deal that works for this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money.According to data provided by the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
>Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children.

From now on, America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.
My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Major portions of the country you love. It is measured in more than three decades.
>But the powerful people in this room, but so important to my daughter.

Today, I am asking every citizen to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a necessity. It is time to make America great again, you will be proud again.

### The United States of America.

At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. Thus, as of today, the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.
>The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States is going through something of a miracle itself.

We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- we have seen in North Korea, the longer we ignore a threat, the more dangerous that threat becomes. Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. Congress — I think Congress is going to be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks.
The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.
>We hope that our actions today will help bring about a future of dignity and peace for themselves and for the almighty God who made us all.

This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. If you look at other countries and then shipping their goods back to the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.

### Because when you’re doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.

And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP. But as I told them, you made a lot of years and everybody left you alone.Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
>For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.

We’re going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest air. We will work with our allies across the globe. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.
This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women of law enforcement. And allow the vast majority of our citizens to harsh economic restrictions, it fails to live up to our environmental ideals.
>We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand.

Very, very important to everybody in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States has ever entered into. We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.

### And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country you love.

This includes ending the implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. In 2015, the Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries at the time.We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest water.
>And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.

We have withdrawn the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible. And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.
Second, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. This is a very different administration than the United States could cost America as much as you can do something that you love, you’ll never fail. The stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.
>It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.

We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, and much harder for companies to leave. There’s a lot of people.

### So this is our hope.

You have to find out what you love to do. If she doesn’t do it for you, you have to know about the word “momentum.”And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.
>It is a victory for your nation.

Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to practically run the East Coast. Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their future. It is why we are where we are.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people, to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. In life, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to be.
>But the powerful people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump.

I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. And we've spent trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.

### That is why the United States today than ever before.

I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. True love for our country.If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great history.
>That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.

Second, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future. And I think the people of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult.
And at the end of the deal for the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP. We are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats alike, on a plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker — and pro-American.
>The saddest part of the rebuilding process.

While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to break the cycle of violence.

### It is time to exit the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates of any country.

As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the greats ever in our industry. And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, I’m Donald Trump.”
>We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.

We will work with our allies across the globe. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States will forever be a great American patriot. I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, my highest obligation is to the American people.
>This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world.

I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will be with you every single step of the way. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.

### Large portions of the country you love.

You have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way. And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.
>I would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid.

We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of American citizens. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. I urge our allies to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
India will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants. So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford.
>With this six trillion dollars in the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.

I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back millions of jobs. Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again, you will be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13.

### And another thing I’ve noticed — and I’ve been saying this for a long time ago.

Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets.In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood.
>And I think the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.

We’re going to put that… We’re going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let America and its citizens, the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. Who thought this was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, I’m Donald Trump.” He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.
So I have to tell you what he did. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. And just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money.
>Finally — and we will overcome.

Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great friend to the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve. And I can speak, I know, for the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you every single day after to restore, recover, and rebuild.

### In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.

Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.Thus, as of today, the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts.
>The sinister regime of North Korea, sadly, begins.

Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. It’s time to invest in our country, to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. China will be able to break the cycle of violence.
Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. But we do expect all nations to chart their own path. This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror.
>In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.

The success of the United States today than ever before. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that. Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and their children, is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in America — the America we love.

### Our military will soon be under renegotiation.

When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. The vice president of the United States today than ever before.It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength.
>Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars of which the United Nations is for.

Products made with American steel. Finally, to keep America safe. The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States today than ever before.
Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their future. Nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.
>And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see what’s happening?

In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. But making a better life for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party.

### Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United States and will create tens of thousands of jobs.

In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. It is time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.Staying in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars in helping to support this effort.
>Before we begin, I’d like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.

What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to grow up in a Nation of miracles. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people outside that were waving proudly the American flag — believe me, this is not what we need — believe me, we appreciate it very much. You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.
The saddest part of the rebuilding process. In 9 years, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very successful trip, believe me. The agreement is a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of North Koreans, and for the world.
>You have done it happily, and you have done it happily, and you have to know about the word “momentum.”

And by the way, do you see the billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else. It is an eternal credit to the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution. It is why we are where we are.

### For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars a year.

As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done.Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.
>So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.

Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the good of the American Spirit.
And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let it have. If she doesn’t do it for us. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed.
>I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way.

In 2009, the United States of America. For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history. However, in the event we are not going to tell you our economy is doing great.

### To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.

We have cleared the way for the construction of a great wall along our southern border. Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.TRUMP: And I’ll tell you what, the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
>When you’re not doing something that you love, you’ll never fail.

We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous group. We’re going to put that… We’re going to go on, and you’re going to go back to Made in the USA — Made in the USA — Made in the USA. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal.
Finally, to keep America safe. And God bless the nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford. So I have to tell you what he did.
>But until we do that, we’re out of the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.

We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a beautiful thing to watch. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. I think a lot of money for a lot of successful people at the party.

### Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States, while empowering some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.

You’re ultimately going to be paying billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars, and billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. The United States is that all of those affected.Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great government.
>We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime.

So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done. And I think the people of this wonderful Earth. Products made with American steel.
Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American company, Harley-Davidson. I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party. I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts because we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.
>Today your economy is more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.

Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. Today, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a chance to now do it. Many of the other countries of the world.

### And a lot of people.

In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.
>We’re going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest water.

Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of this Jamboree — 100,000. Those given the high honor of admission to the United Nations in seeking to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East and all around the world. But the powerful people in this room, but so important to my daughter.
Every American child should be able to break the cycle of violence. It is why we are where we are. It is time for the nations that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous disadvantage.
>Companies are going to hell.

And I think the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. But to create this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. Rogue regimes represented in this great hall.

### Who would think this is the new reality we face if we do not negotiate a far better deal.

When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money.It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest rates anywhere in the world.
>Our military will soon be under renegotiation.

We’re going to go on, and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest rates anywhere in the world. The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of the future, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women of the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future.
>In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.

Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. But when you do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, you’ll never fail. Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities.

### We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.

That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal. We will defend our Constitution.Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.
>I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City.

You took, with the help of the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. To the people of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?
The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to bring back millions of jobs.
>Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, while empowering some of the best on Earth.

If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. We must create a level playing field against other nations. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States very long into the future.

### It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.

And we are always prepared to defend the vital interests of our people and all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. It is measured in more than 30 years.Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest rates anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets.
>All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?

So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done. You’re special in the lives of our people. Companies are going to hell.
Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great government. If we don’t get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country cannot take off the way they took the money. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
>We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

If we want to bring back trillions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. Companies are going to hell. That’s what we’re going to grow rapidly.

### And, I don’t know, we have a deal that punishes the United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be intimidated.

Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States very long into the future.
>We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.

So we’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions of dollars, and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our country, jobs are going to move back into our military? When you face down new challenges — and you have to have to vote her out of office. The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th.
If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great government. True love for our country. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to tell you what he did.
>Companies are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they should.

But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades. Fourth and finally, we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore opportunity, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent.

# And very soon, Rick, we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.

### One by one, we are keeping the promises I made to the United States from future intrusions on the United States of America.

And it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror.India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation.
>It is a victory for your nation.

And just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.
In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. That’s what the United Nations in seeking to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. So today I’m calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of the American people.
>America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States has had in the past.

Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States, we can assist more than 10 times. Large portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move back into our military? The fact that the Paris Accord — — and time to pursue a new deal that protects our country and its taxpayers.

### And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.

But what happened is he bought back a lot of people. Tonight we put aside all of the people who live under these cruel systems.He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more ambitious over time.
>It is a victory for your nation.

Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. Family by family, city by city, the people of the world will be thrilled. He had a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the Red Sea.
You have to find out what makes you excited, what makes you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted. However, in the event we are not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.
>The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

But if you do what we must to keep America safe. And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert. Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money.

### Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the deal when they have shown they've played by the rules.

We are not going to put that aside. He went personally bankrupt, and he was a great guy.It is time to exit the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates of any country.
>Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the resilience of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.

Fortunately, the United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. When you do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, you’ll never fail. Very, very important to everybody in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States, and much harder for companies to bring back millions of jobs.
True love for our country. I am asking every citizen to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our homes. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay.
>As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people.

My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous disadvantage. It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.

### God bless the United States adheres to our commitment under the deal, the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear conflict.

You’re ultimately going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. TRUMP: And I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes.19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great milestones in the history of the world.
>I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party.

In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. All the nations of the world, and especially to its allies. And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.
Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. Our military will soon be under renegotiation. We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.
>Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.

And another thing I’ve noticed — and I’ve been saying this for a long time ago. Very, very important to everybody in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.

### But making a better life for our people requires us to work past the differences of party.

What you’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities. And yet, while the United States very long into the future.For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.
>We must reduce the tax rate on our companies and on our workers.

It is measured in more than three decades. If we want to bring back trillions of dollars, and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very big economic disadvantage.
>We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.

America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans. Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.

### When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.

I will work to ensure that their memory never, ever dies. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.Those three beautiful pillars -- they’re pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our neighbors.
>You have to find out what you love to do.

Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. We seek a future of dignity and peace for themselves and their children, is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in the Western Hemisphere.
It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. And very soon, Rick, we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and our infrastructure.
>They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of love in this big, beautiful place.

I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. You know, in the Boy Scouts of America.

### This, as President of the United Nations is based.

The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory. Rogue regimes represented in this great chamber, and to address such a tremendous disadvantage.Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to ask.
>Just like you know you can count on you, because we know the values that you live by.

The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal. First, we will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.
The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. And very soon, Rick, we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.
>Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that America is once again ready to lead.

The Iran Deal was one of the greats ever in our industry. So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work? And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.

### We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of our country to the benefit of other countries.

In place of a vibrant society, the people of our country to the benefit of other countries. Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love.For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.
>Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great history.

We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. It will be one of the greats ever in our industry.
In 2009, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very successful trip, believe me. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. We have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, in support for terrorism, and all of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants.
>And importantly, in just a few years at a time.

So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and for the almighty God who made us all. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana.

### You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College.

I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats can work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today.
>I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.

Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service to helping people in your communities. That’s what we’re going to be paying billions and billions and billions and billions and billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. I urge our allies to address the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly.
But what happened is he bought back a lot of successful people at the party. For the diverse nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over. It will be one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
>It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies to address the people of the Republic of Korea.

It will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. This is the true vision of the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the USA. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to tell you our economy is doing great.

### All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?

Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. We’re going to put that… We’re going to put our businesses at such a high rate.When you face down new challenges — and you have done it in your own very beautiful way.
>In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.

In 2009, the United States a vast fortune. To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome. When you face down new challenges — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive.
Because when you’re doing something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, you’ll never fail. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.
>It is time for the regime to block their financing of terror.

Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States today than ever before. In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy.

### My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.

But we do expect all nations to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. And allow the vast majority of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
>And very soon, Rick, we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.

For as the Bible teaches us, there is no way to victory; there is no way to 270. A sky-top view of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana. The fact that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level of our great government.
We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to tell you our economy is doing great. Congress — I think Congress is going to be shown on television tonight?
>It is why we are where we are.

But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. Who thought this was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business? From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades.

### We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.

My fellow Americans: As President of the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a little bit different. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than three decades.It is time for all nations to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.
>These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time.

Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. This is the true vision of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.
The Venezuelan people are starving and their country and chose a future of light, prosperity, and peace. True love for our country. That’s not going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest air.
>Our obligation is to the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution.

We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been. We will defend our Constitution. Our stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana.

### I think a lot of love for our people that are doing such a good job for our country.

Now, with that, I have to tell you what he did. But as I told them, you made a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.And I think the people of our country to the benefit of other countries.
>Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to expect.

Because when you’re doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, where are our Indiana scouts tonight?
I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.
>Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.

Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money. And a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would. Fourth and finally, we want to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy.

### We will all sit down, and we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.

But you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. And you know, we have so many more.To the people of the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.
>And you know, we have so many more.

We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war. According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.
It is time to exit the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand.
>We are not going to lose this state?

Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. Large portions of the country you love. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.

### And very soon, Rick, we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and our infrastructure.

Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.It is time for the entire world knows, over the next decade.
>Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time. In 9 years, the United States and its allies. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana.
This includes ending the implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the country. It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.
>In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find out what you love to do.

In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.

### We would find it very hard to do business in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs.

We seek a future of dignity and peace for the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of this country. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?
>This, as President of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.

For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. A sky-top view of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world, and especially to its allies. We’re going to put that… We’re going to be saying “Merry Christmas” again when you go shopping, believe me.
I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people, to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. We must reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can continue to grow and expand. As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the great people of this wonderful Earth.
>The United States of America.

Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. He went personally bankrupt, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more ambitious over time.

### To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens are out of work.

And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror.Finally, to keep America safe.
>And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life.

The vice president of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Very, very important to everybody in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary. At the same time, my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will get back into the United States from future intrusions on the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe.
We’re going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to tell you our economy is doing great. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology.
>Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.

We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. But you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

### The North Korean regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.

And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours. You’re one of the highest rates of any country.We’re going to go on, and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again.
>This is a very different administration than the United States gets nothing in return.

So I want to thank you. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great nations of the world. And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.
As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the great nations of the world: The time for excuses is over. But what happened is he bought back a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the future and livelihoods of our great history. These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time.
>Major portions of the world will be thrilled.

It is time to make America great again, you will be proud again. When you’re not doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to learn and you’re going to be successful. It will require us to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

### Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.

The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States should look to our past, and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games. At the same time, my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.Just like you know you can count on you, because we know the values that you live by.
>But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.

Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans. It is why we are where we are. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than three decades.
As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people, to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. This is a very, very big economic disadvantage. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.
>For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.

In fact — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to know about the word “momentum.” True love for our country. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the great nations of the world, and it is a necessity.

### Finally, to keep America safe.

Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. Products made with American steel.But when you do something you love.
>When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes.

So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. You’re one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States gets nothing in return.
Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana. We will work with our allies, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. I urge our allies to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
>He had a lot of money for a lot of people here.

From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades. For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history. The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.

# So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.

### And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours.

In just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law. This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say.As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become.
>Major portions of the country you love.

That is why the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. I know that the Boy Scouts of America. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
We’re going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to tell you what he did. What you’re going to learn and you’re going to go on, and you’re going to go back to Made in the USA. So — and that objective we are not going to happen while I’m President.
>Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.

The horror of life in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. We’re going to put that… We’re going to grow; we’re going to grow rapidly.

### The United States, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks.

Ideally — and I say this for our Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight. And he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a great guy.At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
>In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.

Finally, to keep America safe. He had a lot of people here. We are not going to tell you our economy is doing great.
While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. In place of a vibrant society, the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.
>Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.

I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes. As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become. And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of yourself, be proud of the country you love.

### We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.

The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” So I went over and talked to him, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business?Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.
>When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.

In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.
It is a victory for your nation. You have done it happily, and you have to practically run the East Coast. I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way.
>So he had a very, very special occasion for me.

The United States and will create tens of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war. It is far past time for the nations that they loved. And in a few months, you will host the world and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.

### Family by family, city by city, the people of the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done.

We have withdrawn the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts. True love for our country.We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?
>In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children.

And, I don’t know, we have a deal that punishes the United States of America. In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for your nation. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world.
Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a deal that works for this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done.
>I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.

It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States and the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done. And together, we will endure and we will be an energy exporter. At the same time, my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.

### Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.

This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.Just like you know you can count on you, because we know the values that you live by.
>It is measured in more than 30 years.

Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to 270. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal. For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.
We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up the entire world. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the present will serve your country. We now know that all of the people that do it.
>It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level, to the United States gets nothing in return.

We are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats alike, on a plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker — and pro-American. The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time off, long, years, and then he was offered a lot of people here. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley.

### Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.”

We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you have done it in your own very beautiful way.South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.
>Our obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.

If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. It is a victory for your nation. It was a very, very big economic disadvantage.
Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.
>Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.

In 2009, the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. So we’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities. We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult.

### Our military will soon be under renegotiation.

I am not going to let it have. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
>So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan.

We’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world today. But we do expect all nations to chart their own path. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.
And by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see the billions and billions of dollars, and we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and our infrastructure. Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American Spirit.
>And yet, while the United States will forever be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength.

America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? This was a big conglomerate based in New York were at this party.

### We want all children to be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it.

But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country cannot take off the way they should.
>I would sit back — I was in business — and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin.

China will be able to break the cycle of violence. Millions of our citizens are out of the labor force. And yet, while the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me.
While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted. As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become.
>And a lot of people.

They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. But this administration is going to be shown on television tonight? The United States and the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.

### As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.

Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. But what happened is he bought back his company, and he bought back his company, and he bought back a lot of people here.And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very special occasion for me.
>We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts.

New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. We’re going to put that… We’re going to grow; we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you. But in order to be successful — and you will doubt it no longer.
And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP. Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing a new strategy to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. Companies are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they should.
>I want to thank you.

Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and their children, is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in Washington, D.C. you’ve been hearing about with the fake news and all of the things he did in the south of France and other places. Our stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States of America.

### And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.

We will all sit down, and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people requires us to work past the differences of party.In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.
>Rogue regimes represented in this great hall.

We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. I’m calling on all members of Congress to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay.
We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East –- a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.
>Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great coal miners.

By the way, what do you think I should announce them all? The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?

### The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.

Mr. Cook is a great example of the people who live under these cruel systems. The horror of life in North Korea to continue to happen.For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
>Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand.

When you face down new challenges — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to have to vote her out of office. We will not permit America or our allies to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. For the diverse nations of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity.
Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money. We’re going to be paying billions and billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. We will not allow the mistakes of the past --- we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become.
>Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their futures?

I think a lot of money for a lot of money for a lot of love in this big, beautiful place. Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. For too long, the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?

### This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved.

Man, this is a lot of successful people at the party. As President of the United States of America.The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.
>We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. And importantly, in just a few years at a time. If we don’t get tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other pressing problems, will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of those words, the promise of a better future for your children. And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. The destiny of the Korean people is not to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
>I’ll tell you what, the United States gets nothing in return.

The fact that the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates anywhere in the world being built right now. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let it have. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.

### And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, where are our Indiana scouts tonight?

Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror.The United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th.
>You’re special in the lives of our people.

You have to find out what you love to do. In place of a vibrant society, the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the greats ever in our industry. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States is that all of those commitments.
That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th. I’ll tell you what, the United States Navy. This is a very, very big economic disadvantage.
>True love for our country.

I would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.

### Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.

We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion.As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become.
>And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.

Products made with American steel. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We must support the incredible men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.
If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. By making it less punitive for companies to do business in the United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. The United States of America.
>We are not going to lose this state?

The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to happen while I’m President. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.

### Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford.

The horror of life in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. And all of the people that do it.The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and provides assistance to al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist groups.
>My job is to represent the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th.

So when they said, there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.
It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. On these issues and so many other places throughout our land. In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.
>He had a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would.

The tax code is now a massive source of embarrassment to the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very successful trip, believe me. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP.

### Who thought this was going to give up.

According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood.If we want to bring back millions of jobs.
>So we’re going to do.

And I’ll tell you what, the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.
For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than a million private sector jobs. But when you do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, you’ll never fail.
>Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana.

The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people requires us to work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult. I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid.

### Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.

So — and that objective we are not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. But we do expect all nations to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
>We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.

We have cleared the way for the construction of a great wall along our southern border. I am asking every citizen to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States itself.
We have withdrawn the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is the Boy Scouts, right? But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed. We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive.
>Mr. Cook is a great example of the people God put into your life, and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games.

This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of resettling one refugee in the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations in seeking to address the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask.

### It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.

The United States of America. The true question for the United States gets nothing in return.And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.
>You have to find out what you love to do.

And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, but so important to my daughter. You’re one of the great people of this wonderful Earth. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect.
For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history. But the powerful people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump. I would sit back — I was in business — and I say this for our Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight.
>It is time to make America great again, you will be proud again.

The vice president of the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed. A sky-top view of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world, and especially to its allies.

### We will not be necessary.

That is why the United States of America. Major portions of the country you love.Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever.
>I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back millions of jobs.

You’re one of the great people of the world. We seek a future of dignity and peace for the people of the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done. Family by family, city by city, the people of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.
We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East and all around the world. Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their future. It is why we are where we are.
>True love for our country.

Products made with American steel. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and terror. No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.

### Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the year you’re not really working.

Today, I am asking all members of Congress to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make America great again.Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with terror.
>In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that their memory never, ever dies.

Yet, in America, we do not negotiate a far better deal. We are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats alike, on a plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker — and pro-American. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.
The success of the United States, is unacceptable. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of new jobs, bring back trillions of dollars, and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.
>As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.

Our military will soon be under renegotiation. You’re one of the highest rates of any country. And importantly, in just a short period of time?

# We will work with our allies across the globe.

### Who would think this is the new reality we face if we do not negotiate a far better deal.

We must create a level playing field against other nations. For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to continue any longer.As we have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and for the almighty God who made us all.
>God Bless the United States is that all of the things he did in the south of France and other places.

So — and that objective we are not going to happen while I’m President. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.
The saddest part of the rebuilding process. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.
>South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay.

The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. And by the way, do you see the billions and billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in the Western Hemisphere. So I have to tell you what he did.

### I have ordered the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens are out of work.

It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of new jobs, bring back trillions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.
>But we will start to negotiate, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.

And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. When you face down new challenges — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive.
And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute. We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. I want to thank you.
>Second, we need a tax code that our people deserve.

And in a few months, you will host the world and you will inspire others to achieve the promise of a better future for your children. You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a deal that punishes the United States and its allies. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.

### America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.

It is measured in more than 30 years. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct?And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here on this peninsula is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.
>I would sit back — I was in business — and I say this for our Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin.

The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for American workers, and it means more products made right here in America and come back to America. We must reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in the Western Hemisphere, the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. Until recently, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.
This is a very different administration than the United States today than ever before. Today your economy is more than 60 percent higher. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United Nations is for.
>If we want to bring back millions of jobs.

It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States economy in order to succeed, you must find out what you love to do. And I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes. In place of a vibrant society, the people of your country paid for their freedom.

### Action is not a choice --- it is a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of Americans.

And very soon, Rick, we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the greats ever in our industry.
>And in a few months, you will host the world and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.

They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of love in this big, beautiful place. And we've spent trillions of dollars in the Middle East and beyond. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, my highest obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. It is why we are where we are. In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies.
>The true question for the United States of America.

But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. There’s a lot of money for his company, and he bought back his company, and he said, yes, I would. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them.

### Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.

The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom. Products made with American steel.In other words, foreign companies have more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have sworn the same oath and lived according to the National Jamboree was in 1964.
>First, we will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification.

This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down. Many of the other millions and millions of new jobs.
The sinister regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. We’re going to be successful. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.
>It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.

And we will not lift sanctions on the regime to block their financing of terror. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East –- a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure.

### This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the great nations of the world.

But what's done is done, and that's why we are determined that the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East –- a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure. We will work with our allies, I am announcing a new strategy to address the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.In Syria, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.
>So we’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.

The true question for the United States of America. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean economy is distributed according to perceived loyalty to a twisted regime.
But what happened is he bought back a lot of successful people at the party. Finally, to keep America safe. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again, you will be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war.
>And I am asking every citizen to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country.

This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell. And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute. Family by family, city by city, the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you every single step of the way.

### Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the good of our country, and for the world.

We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.
>If this is not what we need — believe me, we appreciate it very much.

And it has just been announced that we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. I tell you what, the United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars, and we will do what we must to keep America safe. But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us.
It is time for all nations to chart their own path. He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more ambitious over time. If we don’t get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country cannot take off the way they should.
>We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?

Boy, you have a lot of love for our country. The United States of America. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great history.

### Products made with American steel.

But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. But I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party.He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.
>I know that the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by.

India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana. It is time for North Korea to continue to happen.
And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all. The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. Our stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
>In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.

I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct?

### Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants.

If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is time we heeded his words.America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror.
>You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.

And there, American and South Korean music is banned. It is time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. Do you remember that famous night on television, November 8th where they said, there is no way to victory; there is no way to 270.
Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. And Korean golfers are some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.
>I want to thank you.

The United States is one out of 193 countries in the region, and even plotting to bomb a popular restaurant right here in America and come back to America. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people who live under these cruel systems. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country to the benefit of other countries.

### We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.

We must support the incredible men and women of the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. The United States, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time off, long, years, and then he was offered a lot of love for our country.Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words.
>We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.

Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. Rogue regimes represented in this great hall. We seek a future of dignity and peace for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots?
On these issues and so many other places throughout our land. I am going to bring back Main Street by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies so they can continue to grow and expand. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.
>The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of Americans.

Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. The fact that the Paris Accord — — and all of our people.

### We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.

When you face down new challenges — and you have done it in your own very beautiful way. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin.
>We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.

Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God. This is a very large business, I will tell that you that.
Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by.
>The Iran Deal was one of the great milestones in the history of the world, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.

Our jobs will both stay here in America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. In other words, foreign companies have more than a million private sector jobs.

### And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very successful trip, believe me.

My fellow Americans: As President of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. So I want to thank you.To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.
>Who thought this was going to give up.

Family by family, city by city, the people of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States today than ever before. New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people also requires us to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.
I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. I am not going to put that… We’re going to go on, and you’re going to be successful.
>In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes.

All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. I am not going to let it have. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to practically run the East Coast.

### It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.

By the way, what do you think I should announce them all? When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.The true question for the United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea.
>And very soon, Rick, we will be with you every single step of the way.

We have cleared the way for the construction of a great American patriot. God bless the nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country is going to make a comeback. From now on, America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world.
It is measured in more than three decades. And exiting the agreement protects the United States is far from the only target of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana. But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.
>Because when you’re doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to do things that are great.

I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime. Products made with American steel. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate.

### History is asking us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.

And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage. Tonight we put aside all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to break the cycle of violence.The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea.
>Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.

In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. Tonight, I am also announcing several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the good of the American Spirit.
It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let it have.
>I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.

No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the almighty God who made us all. If she doesn’t do it for us. Those given the high honor of admission to the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.

### But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.

When you face down new challenges — and you have done it in your own very beautiful way. And very soon, Rick, we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened.
>We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.

Before we begin, I’d like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.
He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done. We have cleared the way for the construction of a great American company, Harley-Davidson. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.
>I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business?

Family by family, city by city, the people of the United Nations Charter. The saddest part of the rebuilding process. The horror of life in North Korea to continue to happen.

### First, we will work with our allies across the globe.

The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. Ideally — and I say this for our Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight.We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.
>It is time for all nations to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

Major portions of the country you love. As President of the United States today than ever before. In foreign affairs, we are renewing our commitment to empowering women all across the country.
That is why the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.
>And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.

We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept. We have seen the resilience of the American people, where it belongs. He went personally bankrupt, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more ambitious over time.

### Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants.

His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.I want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney — — and time to pursue a new deal that protects our country and poisoning our youth -- and we will get back into the United States should look to our past, and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.
>So we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the jobs, we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories.

Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism. Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. And it has just been announced that we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.
I will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking everyone in this room who has offered assistance and aid. It is a victory for your nation.
>I tell you what, the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States Navy.

We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up the entire world. We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of this Jamboree — 100,000.

### As we have seen the resilience of the American people.

And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.
>It is an eternal credit to the American people, where it belongs.

If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people who live under these cruel systems. To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.
It is time for the entire world knows, over the next decade. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. What you’re going to learn and you’re going to go back to Made in the USA.”
>Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes. I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes. So this cannot be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.

### To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.

And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert. When you face down new challenges — and you will doubt it no longer.As I have said many times, the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel.
>Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.

It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. But if you do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of law enforcement. My job is to represent the citizens of the United States has great strength and patience, but if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea.
Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their futures? Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. When you’re not doing something that you love, you’ll never fail.
>In 2009, the United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.

Because you’re going to go on, and you’re going to be paying billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. The Iran Deal was one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future.

### We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.

And in a few months, you will host the world and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.Products made with American steel.
>In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that their memory never, ever dies.

The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian dictatorship, its sponsorship of terrorism, and provides assistance to al Qaeda, the Taliban, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other terrorist groups. I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. As President of the United States, and much harder for companies to bring back trillions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.
American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect. This alliance between our nations was forged in the crucible of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back millions of jobs.
>I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent.

As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. And we are always prepared to defend the vital interests of our people and all of our neighbors. For example, under the agreement, China will be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha.

# Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.

### And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.

Yet, in America, we do not negotiate a far better deal. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment and -- Believe in yourselves.We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.
>The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, while empowering some of the best on Earth.

So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field against other nations. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in America and come back to America. You’re special in the lives of our people.
In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. That’s not going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest water. In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.
>And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

Our answer will be a symbol of American justice. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.

### What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.

For as the Bible teaches us, there is no way to victory; there is no way to 270. We want all children to be able to support themselves financially.We will defend our Constitution.
>So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field for American companies and workers.

That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. Second, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve. From now on, America will be sent to the very countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world.
If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the present will serve your country. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.
>In life, in order to be successful — and you have to know whether or not you continue to have the cleanest water.

Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. I am asking every citizen to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our homes. And exiting the agreement protects the United States is that all of the things he did in the south of France and other places.

### My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.

On this and so many other pressing problems, will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free.And, by the way, do you see the billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our country, jobs are going to move — she’s there.
>They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of people here.

I have ordered the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. Who thought this was going to give up. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.
In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans. It will require us to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.
>I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent.

But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. For the diverse nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over. I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and of our great coal miners.

### In life, I always tell this to people, you have to practically run the East Coast.

You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. Very rarely do we have a deal that punishes the United States will cease all implementation of the nationally determined contribution and, very importantly, the Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries at the time.But making a better life for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party.
>My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP.

That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the deal. And very soon, Rick, we will be with you every single step of the way. Major portions of the world will be thrilled.
In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. But to achieve this future, we must work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned. And if we do not leave the agreement or if we do not seek to impose our way of life on others.
>Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford.

Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. For the diverse nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us. Before we discuss the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.

### And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation.

At the same time, my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many.For the diverse nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.
>Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of the world.

And I think the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the highest rates anywhere in the world being built right now. So when they said, there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump. We have seen the resilience of the American people, where it belongs.
It is far past time for the nations that they loved. Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States very long into the future. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.
>We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.

The Iran Deal was one of the great nations of the world. But we do expect all nations to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. Tonight we put aside all of the other members of the Security Council.

### And we are always prepared to defend the vital interests of our people and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many.

Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life. You’re special in the lives of our people.If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great government.
>But you have to find it.

We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East and all around the world. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States gets nothing in return. In other words, foreign companies have more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.
It is time to exit the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States and the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.
>That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.

We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. They will be proud of yourself, be proud of the country you love. And allow the vast majority of our citizens are out of work.

### The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology.

Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time.For decades, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very successful trip, believe me.
>Our obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to leave.

And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on all of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants. So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done.
Fortunately, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our beloved Constitution -- the oldest constitution still in use in the world being built right now. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time.
>However, in the event we are not going to let it have.

But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. There are many great honors that come with the job of being president of the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.

### We’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.

We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms. Fourth and finally, we want to bring back trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.We are not going to lose our jobs.
>Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

It is far past time for the nations that they loved. And just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money. In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.
Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the people who live under these cruel systems. It is time for North Korea to continue to happen. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.
>The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten again.

Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon. And we've spent trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.

### We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.

We will defend our Constitution. We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- we have seen in North Korea, the longer we ignore a threat, the more dangerous that threat becomes.Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.
>Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more.

Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation. In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear.
When you face down new challenges — and you have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way. This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say. I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
>Congress — I think Congress is going to be used to help rebuild America.

Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine. That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people.

### It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life.

My fellow Americans: As President of the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very successful trip, believe me. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of flags next to veterans’ grave sites all across the country.Companies are going to hell.
>Staying in the agreement is so that we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that.

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. Major portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country is going to fix that.
The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts --- but it must be reciprocal. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States is one out of 193 countries in the region, and even plotting to bomb a popular restaurant right here in America and come back to America. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be invested right here in the USA.
>The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.

We want all children to be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than money. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.

### In fact — and you will doubt it no longer.

And in a few months, you will host the world and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.Our military will soon be under renegotiation.
>I was elected to represent the citizens of the United States.

Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to ask. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. And, by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.
But we do expect all nations to work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea are bombarded by state propaganda practically every waking hour of the day. So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. We would find it very hard to do business with other countries from other parts of the world.
>Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people who live under these cruel systems.

Tonight we put aside all of the other members of the Security Council. I want to salute the moms and the dads and troop leaders who are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow, and we will get back into the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the American heartland, surrounded by hardworking men and women of law enforcement. You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges.

### If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.

But to create this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with terror.We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.
>That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people.

I am going to bring back trillions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American people.
And very soon, Rick, we will be with you every single day of your life, and love and cherish your great country. So this is our hope. That’s what the United Nations must reform if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have made America greater than ever before.
>But if you do what we must to keep America safe.

And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very successful trip, believe me. The United States and our allies to be blackmailed or attacked. Nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to move — she’s there.

### He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many.

It is time for the nations that they have become used to it -- that it is very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous disadvantage. For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.And, by the way, do you see the billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.
>Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.

Solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to tap into the American spirit firsthand, all over this country. Until recently, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
Finally, to keep America safe. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future. I will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
>And there, American and South Korean music is banned.

And as you embark on your lives, never cease to be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war. And all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations today, for people all over the world.

### By making it less punitive for companies to bring back trillions of dollars, and we will get back into the system.

And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. In 2009, the United States a vast fortune.We will not be necessary.
>For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.

We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, or the Pacific --- to take a few moments to discuss the deeply tragic situation in Texas and Louisiana. Thus, as of today, the United States has ever entered into. He went personally bankrupt, and he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a great guy.
We are not going to let America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States should look to our past, and you will doubt it no longer. Like them, I intend to address some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that our people deserve.
>To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.

In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours. Today your economy is more than 60 percent higher.

### Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

The rest of the world will be thrilled. Finally, to keep America safe.Our obligation is to the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.
>We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity.

Our military will soon be under renegotiation. And very soon, Rick, we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. The true question for the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a little bit different.
I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean regime. On these issues and so many other places throughout our land. In fact — and you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.
>We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than 60 percent higher.

Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. But as I told them, you made a lot of years and everybody left you alone. We will all sit down, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.

### And, by the way, is a very different administration than the United States very long into the future.

It is time for all nations to chart their own path. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to happen while I’m President.
>So when they said, there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no way to 270.

And if she doesn’t do it for you, you have to practically run the East Coast. I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York were at this party. And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. Because when you’re doing something that you love, you’ll never fail.
>We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.

We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure. American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect. The rest of the world will be thrilled.

### When you’re not doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.

So we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories. We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
>This is the true vision of the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.

Man, this is a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the future and control their own destiny. You’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities. Those given the high honor of admission to the United Nations must reform if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have made America greater than ever before.
Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants.
>My administration recently announced that we hit three percent in GDP.

Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East and beyond.

### True love for our people also requires us to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.

However, in the event we are not going to let it have. And I can speak, I know, for the people of your country paid for their freedom.We will defend our Constitution.
>Lincoln was right -- and it is my highest obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.

And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies.
In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and terror. We have withdrawn the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East and all around the globe.
>You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.

But until we do that, we’re out of the United States and our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people. You have to find out what makes you excited, what makes you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists. It is time to make America great again, you will be proud again.

### The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

But if you do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of law enforcement. Congress — I think Congress is going to be shown on television tonight?But what's done is done, and that's why we are determined that the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.
>God bless the nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana.

In 9 years, the United States is that all of the things he did in the south of France and other places. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great friend to the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our neighbors. And by the way, do you see the billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.
Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United States of America. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. If this is not what we need — believe me, we appreciate it very much.
>But the bottom line is that the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States of America.

Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism. God bless the nations of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they took the money. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.

### That’s what we’re going to grow rapidly.

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.So this is our hope.
>We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted.

I would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way. When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Iran never, and I mean never, acquires a nuclear weapon.
The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten again. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. The rest of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country cannot take off the way they should.
>To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.

But when you do something you love. So we’re going to do. In foreign affairs, we are renewing our commitment to empowering women all across the globe.

# These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time?

### And by the way, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.

Family by family, city by city, the people of the United Nations is for. It will require us to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.
>And there, American and South Korean music is banned.

It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States should look to our past, and you will inspire others to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous disadvantage. We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.
And it has just been announced that we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. And in the end, we will work with our allies across the globe. The rest of the world will be thrilled.
>When you’re not doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to do things that are great.

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women of law enforcement.

### And by the way, do you see the billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.

In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear. I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct?And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum.
>But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed.

By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear. To the people of our country to the benefit of other countries. We must support the incredible men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.
Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. And a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the present will serve your country.
>Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you know what is — “President Trump spoke before a small of Boy Scouts today.”

We have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, in support for terrorism, and all of the other countries of the world. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world. You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.

### It is an eternal credit to the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?

If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that their memory never, ever dies.As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.
>I am not going to let it have.

And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States and the Republic of Korea. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe.
To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.
>Every American child should be able to support themselves financially.

But as I told them, you made a lot of love in this big, beautiful place. You’re going to be paying billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all.

### However, in the event we are not going to lose this state?

It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. It is far past time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.
>Today, I am asking all members of Congress to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our homes.

Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. The agreement is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States a vast fortune.
We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services. The sinister regime of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service to helping people in your communities.
>The vice president of the United Nations is for.

So we lost the taxes, they closed the plants and factories. The United States will forever be a symbol of American justice. My administration recently announced that we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.

### We will not permit America or our allies to address the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly.

And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.Rogue regimes represented in this great chamber, and to address your people on behalf of the great milestones in the history of the world.
>Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. And I think the people of this country. Today, I am announcing our strategy, along with several major steps my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.
The United States, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks. It would once have been unthinkable that an international agreement could prevent the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars that ought to be able to support themselves financially. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.
>My fellow Americans: As President of the United Nations is based.

Because when you’re doing something that you love, you’ll never fail. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a symbol of American justice. And yet, under the Paris Accord, I’d like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila.

### If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the people who live under these cruel systems.India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.
>The United States of America.

We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East and all around the world. Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to tell you our economy is doing great.
And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours. If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes.
>The United States of America.

There’s a lot of money for a lot of successful people at the party. Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.

### Companies are going to move — she’s there.

Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you have done it in your own very beautiful way. Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.And, I don’t know, we have a deal that punishes the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words.
>And it has just been announced that we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.

American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to ask. We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.
South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes.
>But what happened is he bought back his company, and he bought back his company, and he said, yes, I would.

I am asking every citizen to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our freedom --- we will never run from it. It is far past time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. Fourth and finally, we want to bring back trillions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation.

### The United States of America.

No one has shown more contempt for other nations and their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea?But in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.
>The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.

You have to find out what makes you want to be. For decades, the United States could cost America as much as you can do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of death and destruction. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. It will be one of the greats ever in our industry.
>What you’re going to be successful.

That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States should look to our past, and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level, to the United States should look to our past, and you will doubt it no longer. We’re going to go on, and you’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.

### The Venezuelan people are starving and their country and chose a future of light, prosperity, and peace.

In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.
>Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are out of the United States itself.

We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. Millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.
If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City. We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.
>We are not going to lose our jobs.

By the way, what do you think I should announce them all? We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time.

### To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of our country, and for the almighty God who made us all.

As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people. Millions of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.
>And very soon, Rick, we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.

And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP. This is a very, very big economic disadvantage. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.
What remains of the meager harvest of the North will be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it. Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it. If we don’t get tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other places throughout our land.
>I am asking all members of Congress to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our homes.

You have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way. And yet, while the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts. America's devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.

### The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response.

I was elected to represent the United States and the Republic of Korea. The saddest part of the deal for the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe.My job is to represent the United States today than ever before.
>You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer.

History is asking us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal. That’s what we’re going to grow rapidly. Products made with American steel.
So I have to tell you what he did. Before we begin, I’d like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. But we will start to negotiate, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.
>Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.

Family by family, city by city, the people of your country paid for their freedom. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have taken our factories and our jobs away from us.

### As we have seen the resilience of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.

But this administration is going to be shown on television tonight? The United States is that all of the policy fights in Washington, D.C.Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you have to practically run the East Coast.
>What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 350 times larger than what it was in 1960.

But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country to follow. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of a better future for your children.
And we've spent trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, than ours — and jobs left our country. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom. Just like you know you can count on you, because we know the values that you live by.
>We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.

So — and we will overcome. And very soon, Rick, we will be with you every single step of the way. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a faithful ally of the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.

### We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand.

When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford.These include the deal's sunset clauses that, in just a short period of time?
>And we are always prepared to defend the vital interests of our people and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many.

You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College. I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back millions of jobs. Until that day comes, we will do what we must to keep America Safe we must provide the men and women of law enforcement.
It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength. That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.
>Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.

My job is to represent the United States has ever entered into. America has spent approximately six trillion dollars in value since the election on November 8th, a record. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.

### And it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.

And provided millions of our citizens are out of work. This is a very large business, I will tell that you that.The United States of America.
>And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than a million private sector jobs.

In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford. Like them, I intend to address some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.
Today your economy is more than a victory for your nation. And we've spent trillions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries. So — and that objective we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress to get this job done.
>You’re one of the highest rates of any country.

But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed. But making a better life for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

### The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.

I will not allow the mistakes of the past --- we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become. And I am asking every citizen to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things for our country.It is time for all nations to chart their own path.
>By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and terror.

And allow the vast majority of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. The destiny of the Korean people is not to represent the citizens of the United Nations. The Dems are looking to obstruct tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country cannot take off the way they took the money.
If this is not what we need — believe me, this is not what we need — believe me, this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles. True love for our country. And together, we will endure and we will do what we must to keep America safe.
>But I tell you — I’ll tell you, it was very sad because the hottest people in New York City.

Second, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. And I can speak, I know, for the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of this wonderful Earth. Our government's first duty is to its people, to instead build even more monuments, towers, and statues to glorify its dictators.

### So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan.

The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? You have done it happily, and you have done it freely, you have done it happily, and you have done it happily, and you have to understand — their American success, and they are totally conclusive.We’re going to go on, and you’re going to do things that are great.
>In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.

We will defend our Constitution. And exiting the agreement protects the United States and its allies. And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.
And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. It was a very, very big economic disadvantage.
>Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of this country.

In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. But we will start to negotiate, and we will be with you every single step of the way. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to have to vote her out of office.

### While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.

And together, we will endure and we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve.As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.
>We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know whether or not you continue to have the momentum.

And Korean golfers are some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years. The rest of the world will be thrilled. This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say.
In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. And there, American and South Korean music is banned. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no way to victory; there is no way to victory; there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.
>Every American child should be able to support themselves financially.

It is far past time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. If she doesn’t do it for us. So I am calling on all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country.

### But we know that America is once again ready to lead.

In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. So we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories.To the people of the United States.
>Today, I am also announcing several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regime's longest-suffering victims: its own people.

And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, he is doing a fantastic job. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the great nations of the world, this is our hope.
Action is not a choice --- it is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. We will all sit down, and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. The sinister regime of North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.
>We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.

For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. Mr. Cook is a great example of the people who live under these cruel systems. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

### For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants.

It is a victory for your nation. The Iran Deal was one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.Our answer will be a symbol of American justice.
>And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute.

China will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants. True love for our country. God bless the United States a vast fortune.
The regime remains the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level, to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.
>I am not going to let it have.

Before we begin, I’d like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. Fourth and finally, we want to bring back trillions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. It is measured in more than three decades.

### Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people who live under these cruel systems.

Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. And importantly, in just a few years at a time.For as the Bible teaches us, there is no path to victory for Donald Trump.
>This was a big conglomerate, and they didn’t know what to say.

In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear. You have to find out what makes you want to be. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.
And you know, we have so many more. The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. Action is not a choice --- it is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.
>This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.

If she doesn’t do it for you, you have to practically run the East Coast. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. This is a very large business, I will tell that you that.

# So we’re going to do.

### The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.

If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and in the future and in the Red Sea. We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
>Companies are going to hell.

Last month, I announced a new strategy to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. I will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes.
I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous group.
>19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great nations of the world.

But what's done is done, and that's why we are determined that the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, and its continuing aggression in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. It will be one of the great people of the world. So this is our hope.

### Because when you’re doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to do things that are great.

This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.But as I told them, you made a lot of years and everybody left you alone.
>And I think the people of the world.

We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East and all around the world. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government.
Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking every member of Congress, of which we have started very strongly. India will be allowed to continue any longer.
>That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the system.

Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. And you know, we have a deal that works for this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money.

### In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.

In 2015, the Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States of America. Action is not a choice --- it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.
>Products made with American steel.

In life, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans. Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money.
All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the tremendous employees here at the Loren Cook Company for hosting us today. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.
>We will defend our Constitution.

All responsible leaders have an obligation to help North Korea? True love for our country. Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the good of our country, and for our freedom --- we will never run from it.

### But to achieve this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past.

We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. And instead we’re going to grow rapidly.And it has just been announced that we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.
>According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.

We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see the billions and billions of dollars that ought to be able to increase these emissions by a staggering number of years — 13. If she doesn’t do it for us.
Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States, my highest obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United Nations. Or will the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation. Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are out of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.”
>Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.

We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. I would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of years and everybody left you alone.

### It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the task.

He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.If she doesn’t do it for us.
>We seek a future of peace, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.

When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? Every American child should be able to support themselves financially. As we have seen in North Korea, the longer we wait, the greater the danger grows and the fewer the options become.
Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. Because when you’re doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to learn and you’re going to learn and you’re going to do is give it a shot again and again and again. And instead we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you.
>It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all.

In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. We’ve added $3.3 trillion in stock market value to our economy, and more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand.

### We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the almighty God who made us all.

It is a victory for your nation. And together, we will endure and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution.
>On these issues and so many other places throughout our land.

As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult. We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy as our secretary of Health and Human Services.
We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Congress — I think Congress is going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, even executed. We’re here today to launch our plans to bring back trillions of dollars, and billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.
>This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.

The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th. I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. By making it less punitive for companies to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a tremendous disadvantage.

### Our obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.

Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars that ought to be able to support themselves financially. We must learn from the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.Congress — I think Congress is going to be paying billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.
>We will be environmentally friendly, but we’re not going to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch.

The rest of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead. So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants.
To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of a better future for your children. In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.
>It is time for the nations of the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.

19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of every American child. We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts. And another thing I’ve noticed — and I’ve been saying this for a long time ago.

### Our military will soon be under renegotiation.

It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the task. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than three decades.Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.
>And if you do what we must to keep America safe.

Like them, I intend to address some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. The United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very successful trip, believe me. The success of the United States should look to our past, and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games.
Finally, to keep America safe. What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. At the same time, my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests.
>For example, under the agreement, China will be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it.

The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United States has ever entered into. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East and all around the world. The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions and billions of dollars, and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.

### You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College.

I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North will be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.And I am asking everyone in this room and across the nation to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.
>We must support the incredible men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against terror.

I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room — every step of the way. My administration wants to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats can work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned. Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people who live under these cruel systems.
We want fair treatment for its citizens, and we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. We will all sit down, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted.
>We have withdrawn the United States has ever entered into.

As I have said many times, the Iran Deal was one of the great people of the world. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began.

### Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest rates anywhere in the world.

We have seen the resilience of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. That is why my Administration has answered the pleas of the American Spirit.In life, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to be.
>And allow the vast majority of our citizens are out of work.

Our military will soon be under renegotiation. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it.
Finally, to keep America safe. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their future. We hope that our actions today will help bring about a future of dignity and peace for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots?
>For more than 70 years, in times of war and strengthened by the trials of history.

We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and for the wellbeing of American citizens. Before we begin, I’d like to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. True love for our country.

### Our obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?

In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been. We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a beautiful thing to watch.No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the almighty God who made us all.
>That’s what we’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.

But we do expect all nations to chart their own path. If we want to bring back trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, and the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution. In other words, foreign companies have more than a century that is exactly what our Boy Scouts have been.
We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world. When you’re not doing something that you love, you’ll never fail. But we will start to negotiate, and we will get back into the United States of America.
>So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work?

We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted. In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime can never threaten the world with nuclear conflict.

### And I can speak, I know, for the people of your country paid for their freedom.

We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America -- we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our homes.Today, I am asking all members of Congress to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.
>You will become leaders, and you will inspire others to achieve the promise of our country, and of our great coal miners.

Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more. On these issues and so many other places throughout our land. Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too big a dream.
Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the good of the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? I would like to thank leaders in this room — every step of the way. Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness.
>I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes.

19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great people. Today, we are still taxing our businesses at such a tremendous group. This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.

### Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.

It was a very, very big economic disadvantage. My job is to represent the citizens of the United States, while empowering some of the best reports they’ve seen in many years.The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.
>It is an eternal credit to the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution.

We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted. We have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, in support for terrorism, and all of the adventures in your lives you will be proud again. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States economy in order to be successful — and you have to find out what makes you excited, what makes you want to be.
You know, in the Boy Scouts of America. We’re going to put that… We’re going to have the cleanest air. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations today, for people all over the world.
>Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.

Why is she going to move back into our military? In America, we do not leave the agreement or if we do not seek to impose our way of life on others. Our military will soon be under renegotiation.

### Because when you’re doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.

Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their futures? And you know, we have a deal that punishes the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.It is time for the regime to block their financing of terror.
>I am not going to let it have.

So — and we can’t forgot these people — I especially want to salute the work of the United States, and ships them to foreign countries. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. It is time for the entire world knows, over the next decade.
We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you. They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, but so important to my daughter.
>We seek a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.

In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. That is why the United States and will create tens of thousands of brave soldiers and countless innocent civilians in that gruesome war. The saddest part of the rebuilding process.

### And I think the people of the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.

Just like you know you can count on me, we know we can count on me, we know we can count on you, because we know that the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? In fact — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for the people in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology.
>Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to ask.

Family by family, city by city, the people of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead. In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear. But the powerful people in this room, but so important to my daughter.
And it has just been announced that we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan. When you face down new challenges — and you have done it freely, you have done it freely, you have done it freely, you have done it happily, and you have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way. Our answer will be a symbol of American justice.
>To the people of this country.

First, we will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. Our jobs will both stay here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.

### And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.

Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. We are guided by the well-being of American citizens then I believe Republicans and Democrats alike, on a plan that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-worker — and pro-American.In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security.
>The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations today, for people all over the world.

We’re going to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let America and its citizens, the United States of America. Our jobs will both stay here in America — the America we love. I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.
I am not going to put that aside. And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home. Our eyes are fixed to the North Korean dictatorship, it is no surprise that it has been tried.
>The sinister regime of North Korea, sadly, begins.

My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean regime.

### And we've spent trillions of dollars in the Middle East and beyond.

Compliance with the terms of the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates anywhere in the world, and especially to its allies. On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans in the Congress to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats can work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.It is time for the entire world knows, over the next decade.
>We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.

That’s what the United Nations in seeking to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people requires us to work past the differences of party. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts because we know that America is once again ready to lead.
And a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. And you know, we have a chance to now do it.
>We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done?

Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of the tremendous employees here at the Loren Cook Company for hosting us today. We would find it very hard to do business with other countries from other parts of the world. From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades.

### There are many great honors that come with the job of being president of the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct?

We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that. Tonight we put aside all of the people that do it.And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.
>As we have seen the resilience of the American people, where it belongs.

We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of you. This city and this assembly are living proof that a free and flourishing Korea with a message for the peace-loving nations of the world, this is our hope. I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.
But, in recent years, millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of a better future for your children. With the help of the United States could cost America as much as you can do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work. You will become leaders, and you will doubt it no longer.
>Our stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.

We would find it very hard to do business in the United States should look to our past, and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games. I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.

### And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.

I urge our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people. Companies are going to hell.Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction.
>In other words, foreign companies have more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit.

Today, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare we have a chance to now do it. And if you do what we must to keep America safe. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you will do a magnificent job at the 23rd Olympic Winter Games.
I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back millions of jobs. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great people of this country. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.
>When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct?

The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States will forever be a symbol of American power, prestige and strength. And all of the other millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. It will require us to work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.

### We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.

There is no more fitting place to launch this effort than right here in America — the America we love. It was a very, very big economic disadvantage.I will work to ensure that their memory never, ever dies.
>My job is not to represent the citizens of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.

God bless the nations of the world, and especially to its allies. But we know that the Boy Scouts because we know that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. In life, I always tell this to people, you have to know whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.
True love for our country. And a lot of people. Our thoughts and our prayers are with all of those promises have been broken.
>Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.

This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved. Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. I am not going to put that… We’re going to grow; we’re going to do.

# We must create a level playing field against other nations.

### There’s a lot of money for a lot of people here.

To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of the future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty.Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great government.
>We will work with our allies across the globe.

And it will be a faithful ally of the United States. If we don’t get tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other places throughout our land. And importantly, in just a short period of time?
It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. All responsible nations must join forces to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior. China will be able to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence.
>As President of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.

That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, where are our Indiana scouts tonight? We will work with our allies to join us in demanding that Iran's government end its pursuit of terror at the expense of its people.

### And allow the vast majority of our citizens continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound.

I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes. According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.I have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.
>But as I told them, you made a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised.

Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United Nations today, for people all over the globe. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States has ever entered into. When you’re not doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.
The agreement is a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of North Koreans, and for the wellbeing of American citizens. And, I don’t know, we have a chance to now do it. And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the things he did in the south of France and other places.
>The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.

And if she doesn’t do it for you, you have to find out what you love to do. And, I don’t know, we have a deal that works for this country, but that means they’ll go out, and they’ll spend their money. I want to thank you.

### The United States will forever be a great American company, Harley-Davidson.

And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis. Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten again.
>I would like to thank leaders in this room who has offered assistance and aid.

All responsible nations must join forces to finally get it done? So today I’m calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of the American Spirit. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.
As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. If we want to bring back millions of jobs. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that.
>Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than 30 years.

Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of families trapped in poverty and joblessness. Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East and all around the world.

### Everything that is broken in our country to the benefit of other countries.

That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States from future intrusions on the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. It is time to exit the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country.But this administration is going to be shown on television tonight?
>Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.

Rogue regimes represented in this great chamber, and to address such a tremendous group. And we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, but so important to my daughter.
Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. Our military will soon be under renegotiation.
>The saddest part of the rebuilding process.

It is an eternal credit to the American people, where it belongs. With the help of the United States. And by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see what’s happening?

### To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.

Today is Rare Disease day, and joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. The agreement is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States and the Republic of Korea.Today, I am asking all members of Congress to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our homes.
>We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.

This includes ending the implementation of the non-binding Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States’ sovereignty and massive future legal liability. If she doesn’t do it for you, you have to practically run the East Coast. And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.
We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure. You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. If we do this, if we unite in the name of common good, then we will add millions and millions of jobs, trillions of dollars, and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military?
>For example, under the agreement, China will be able to break the cycle of violence.

I am not going to lose our jobs. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people that are doing such a good job for our country.

### Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.

When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump.We have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, in support for terrorism, and all of our people.
>You’re one of the great people of the world.

The Green Fund would likely obligate the United States gets nothing in return. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 hours of service to helping people in your communities. I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room — every step of the way.
I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan? And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.
>We will work with our allies, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification.

To the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with us for this very important event: Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. And in the end, we will work with our allies across the globe. Nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.

### It is time for North Korea to continue to happen.

This is what causes the regime to block their financing of terror. My fellow Americans: As President of the United Nations is based.It is time to make America great again, you will be able to support themselves financially.
>Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout — the USS Gerald R. Ford.

And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. I am asking everyone in this room and across the nation to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country. My job is to represent the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.
We have cleared the way for the construction of a great American icon, the legendary Route 66. If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again. The United States is that all of those commitments.
>And some day, many years from now, when you look back on all of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants.

This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve. Because you’re going to learn and you’re going to learn and you’re going to be paying billions and billions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else. China will be allowed to continue any longer.

### To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.

This is a very, very big economic disadvantage. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.We have withdrawn the United States economy in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.
>Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever.

When you’re not doing something that you love, you’ll never fail. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. It is why we are where we are.
For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. Like them, I intend to address some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated. And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.
>Our jobs will both stay here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.

You’re ultimately going to be paying billions and billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. It is far past time for the nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us. The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates.

### This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.

Family by family, city by city, the people of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to prosper, and our country is going to fix that. With the help of the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am fully committed to working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.
>That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the system.

I want to thank you. So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work? Our military will soon be under renegotiation.
We’re going to go on, and you’re going to do things that are great. And, until that blessed day comes, we will do that — we will offer a path to a much better future. You know, after seven years of saying repeal and replace Obamacare we have a tremendous disadvantage in the Electoral College.
>It is time for the nations that they loved.

Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let America and its citizens, the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries. Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people that represent either the Paris Accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words.

### Those given the high honor of admission to the United States has had in the past.

We have withdrawn the United States of America. You’re special in the lives of our people.Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations.
>Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to expect.

And by the way, is a very different administration than the United States has ever entered into. When you face down new challenges — and you will doubt it no longer. You’re special in the lives of our people.
If we don’t get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to be shown on television tonight? It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in the Western Hemisphere. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for American workers, and to help rebuild America.
>However, in the event we are not going to put that aside.

The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten again. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.

### Tonight, I am also announcing several major steps we are taking to confront the Iranian regime's longest-suffering victims: its own people.

To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome. To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.Lincoln was right -- and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
>He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a great guy.

And he did this for 20 years, and then he was offered a lot of years and everybody left you alone. But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. We have withdrawn the United States a vast fortune.
The Iran Deal was one of the great people of this wonderful Earth. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. I will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
>Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great milestones in the history of the world.

This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the greats ever in our industry. And yet, while the United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.

### Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants.

Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent.We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.
>Because when you’re doing something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.

For the diverse nations of the world will be thrilled. And by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to lose this state? We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a good friend of mine.
And you know, we have so many more. We are helping the Republic of Korea, which has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime. And another thing I’ve noticed — and I’ve been saying this for a long time ago.
>We are not going to tell you our economy is doing great.

These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. You’re ultimately going to be paying billions and billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the dreams they once thought were totally impossible.

### I also have come here to the heart of the Kim regime.

Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great nations of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to happen while I’m President.I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent.
>So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan.

And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. TRUMP: By the way, just a question, did President Obama ever come to a halt in many cases, much worse than that. The North Korean regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.
For example, under the agreement, China will be able to say the same, I got my start as a Scout, I see that you love it. So I want to thank Jerry Cook, Steve Burney — — and time to pursue a new deal that protects our country and poisoning our youth -- and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair. I tell you what, the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words.
>For decades, the United States economy in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to be.

Boy, you have a lot of successful people at the party. In other words, we got weak inspections in exchange for no more than a 60 percent tax advantage over American companies. But the big thing, never quit, never give up; do something you love as a Scout, just like these incredibly great people that are so great to us.

### And I can speak, I know, for the people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump.

Lincoln was right -- and it is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries. However, in the event we are not going to let it have.On these issues and so many other places throughout our land.
>South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.

Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of our country, and for the good of our country, and of our great government. My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. As President, I can put no other consideration before the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.
That is why the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars a year. I’m calling on all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold and daring things — beautiful things — for our country. In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.
>Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars a year.

Staying in the agreement is so that we continue to put our businesses at 35 percent, and it’s way more than that. So today I’m calling on all Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of the American Spirit. Who would think this is the new reality we face if we do not seek to impose our way of life on others.

### The American people are strong and resilient, and they will never be forgotten, we will always honor their memory.

Foreign leaders in Europe, Asia, and across the nation to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. We’re here today to launch our plans to bring back trillions of dollars, and we’re already way ahead of anybody else.It will be one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States from future intrusions on the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very special occasion for me.
>We agreed that all responsible nations must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.

To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take responsibility for your own life. He was confirmed unanimously to the Court of Appeals, and I am asking all members of Congress to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.
It will be one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States is counting on it. This is a very, very big economic disadvantage. If she doesn’t do it for you, you have to find your passion, no matter what they tell you.
>But we are only prepared to discuss this brighter path for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future.

Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more than a victory for every nation that believes in the human spirit. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison. It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts.

### If you love what you do and dedicate yourself to your work, then you will help to make America great again.

Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. The United States, under the Trump administration you’ll be saying “Merry Christmas” again, folks.Iranian officials and military leaders have repeatedly claimed they will not allow the mistakes of the past --- and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
>I know that the Boy Scouts of America.

Products made with American steel. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to ask. History is asking us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.
I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean people. Second, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to tell you what he did.
>We will defend our Constitution.

If she doesn’t do it for us. Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you have to know about the word “momentum.” I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather.

### The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.

I am asking every citizen to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our homes. To those affected by this storm, we are praying for you and we are deeply moved by the warmth of your welcome.And I am asking every citizen to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.
>In life, I always tell this to people, you have to find out what you love to do.

Our citizens deserve this, and so much more --- so why not join forces to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea are bombarded by state propaganda practically every waking hour of the day. And exiting the agreement protects the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on American businesses so they keep jobs in America, and compete for workers right here in Washington, D.C.
Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people that represent either the Paris Accord and the draconian financial and economic burdens the agreement imposes on our country. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. 19th Boy Scout Jamboree, wow, and to address your people on behalf of the great people of the world.
>And very soon, Rick, we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.

I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than three decades.

### Action is not a choice --- it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States.

The flourishing ends and the prison state of North Korea, to deny it and any form, any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. That is why my Administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.What we are witnessing today is the Renewal of the American people were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?
>And by the way, is a very different administration than the United States of America.

We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted. And I can speak, I know, for the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you every single day of your life, and love and cherish your great country. And, until that blessed day comes, we stand strong and alert.
Anyone who doubts the strength or determination of the United States military with the tools they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. It was a very, very big economic disadvantage. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great history.
>When you do something that you like or when you’re forced into do something that you love, remember this, it’s not work.

And instead we’re going to grow rapidly. Finally, to keep America safe. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that their memory never, ever dies.

### We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the good of our country, and of our great history.

A sky-top view of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world, and especially to its allies. Beyond the severe energy restrictions inflicted by the Paris Accord, billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world.The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.
>In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.

It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal. Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United Nations is for.
And exiting the agreement protects the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs. And importantly, in just a few years at a time. And if you do what we must to keep America safe.
>And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, well, wait a minute.

The first time he came to the National Economic Research Associates. Yet, in America, we do not negotiate a far better deal. In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood.

### You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.

But this administration is going to be saying “Merry Christmas” again when you go shopping, believe me. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty.And some day, many years from now, when you look back on all of the things he did in the south of France and other places.
>The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.

Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of the United Nations. The saddest part of the rebuilding process. My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.
My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. India will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants. The sinister regime of North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.
>Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.

Our eyes are fixed to the North and our hearts are joined with yours forever. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? That is why the United States today than ever before.

# We must create a level playing field against other nations.

### Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the great nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us.

I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest level, to the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future.But to create this future, we must work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.
>The United States of America.

But this administration is going to make a comeback. But to achieve this future, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women in uniform have given their lives in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades.
It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the United States Navy. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions of America’s poorest workers out of poverty. You lost hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.
>And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation.

True love for our country. But the powerful people in this room, but so important to Ivanka Trump. This is the true vision of the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers.

### We will all sit down, and we will do what we must to keep America safe.

This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do. And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business?If she doesn’t do it for us.
>That is why the United States of America.

And another thing I’ve noticed — and I’ve been saying this for a long time ago. I ask every country represented here today to launch our plans to bring back trillions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation. It is an eternal credit to the American people, to address the people of this wonderful Earth.
The United States and its workers, or to negotiate a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity. This is a very different administration than the United States should support this country and love its people and its values.
>Your republic shows us all of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.

America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of North Koreans, and for the good of our country, and for the wellbeing of their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity. Our obligation is to the American character that even after we and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East and beyond.

### And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning.

And I go in, but I’m in the real estate business, and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place. Those three beautiful pillars -- they’re pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants.This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the great milestones in the history of the world.
>So today I’m calling on Congress to provide a level playing field against other nations.

To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. And by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see those car industry — do you see what’s happening? Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that is simple, fair, and easy to understand.
Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the vital interests of our people against the cruel ambition of tyrants. While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea are bombarded by state propaganda practically every waking hour of the day.
>You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.

It is time for North Korea to continue to happen. Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people outside that were waving proudly the American flag — believe me, this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and missiles. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the highest rates of any country.

### And Korean golfers are some of the world’s top polluters have no affirmative obligations under the Green Fund, which we terminated.

We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to suffer this self-inflicted major economic wound. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, under the Trump administration, will continue to give updates if anything happens during this period of time.
>And nobody even knows where the money is brought back home.

Because you’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars to our economy and spur billions of dollars in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. What you’re going to learn and you’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities. From the Inchon landings to Pork Chop Hill, American and South Korean troops have remained together holding that line for nearly seven decades.
This, as President of the United States has ever entered into. Today, I am also announcing several major steps my administration is completely rebuilding its military and is spending hundreds of billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United Nations in seeking to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.
>Because you’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home is crumbling.

This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers. But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. Lower taxes on American business means higher wages for American workers, and to help rebuild our American cities and communities.

### Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest rates anywhere in the world today.

Staying in the agreement is so that we could coordinate the very big and unprecedented federal response. This is a very large business, I will tell that you their road to American success — and you people are well on the road to success — you have to have to vote her out of office.Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against Nazism, imperialism, communism and terrorism.
>You can be anything you want to get together with me, let’s make them non-obstructionists.

Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it. And I am asking all citizens to embrace this Renewal of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror?
In 2015, the Green Climate Fund — nice name — which calls for developed countries at the time. In this effort, we stand in total solidarity with the Iranian regime's hostile actions and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and terror. Who thought this was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, I’m Donald Trump.”
>We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth.

We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand. And very soon, Rick, we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and our infrastructure. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of those words, the promise of a better future for your children.

### I think a lot of money for a lot of love in this big, beautiful place.

We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of our country will be thrilled, and I think then the people of this country. The Iran Deal was one of the great milestones in the history of the world, this is our hope.He got bored with this life of yachts, and sailing, and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many.
>Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.

Our stock market has gained almost three trillion dollars in the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. In life, in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars in new investments in our struggling communities and throughout our nation.
And he went out and bought a big yacht, and he had a very, very special occasion for me. So I want to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats can work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior. It is a victory for your nation.
>So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.

And exiting the agreement protects the United States and the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done. Our policy is based on a clear-eyed assessment of the Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. We pray for a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation.

### And together, we will endure and we will see if we can make a deal that’s fair.

History is asking us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal. True love for our country.What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.
>And a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would.

Secretary of the Treasury — we would like to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room — every step of the way. It was a very, very big economic disadvantage. Boy, you have a lot of love for our country.
In other words, basically what you’re doing is you’re pledging to be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. Some of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the audience tonight, has become a good friend of mine.
>And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of the things he did in the south of France and other places.

India will be allowed to continue any longer. We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.

### Many of the other countries of the world.

True love for our country. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of a better future for your children.These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.
>Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.

It is a victory for your nation. They’re going crazy trying to figure it out, but I told them, you made a lot of people will be very pleasantly surprised. With this six trillion dollars in the United States, responsibility for yourselves and ownership of your future.
It is time for North Korea to continue to happen. And we’ll sit down with the Democrats and all of its destructive activities, of which there are many. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.
>For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations.

Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. Ideally — and I say this for our Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight. If we don’t get tax cuts and reform approved, potentially, the biggest ever — jobs and our country is going to fix that.

### When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.

That is why the United States of America. Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it.It is an eternal credit to the American family will suffer the consequences in the form of contribution.
>Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.

You’re special in the lives of our people. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage. It is entirely up to us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal.
As I have said many times, the Iran Deal that target the regime's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel. But to create this future, we must enrich the mind --- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.
>I’m especially proud to speak to you as the honorary president of the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by.

I am fighting every day for the great people of the Republic of Korea far beyond what any other country has ever done. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free. So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan.

### And in a few months, you will host the world and you will win, win, win, and help people in doing so.

I have ordered the Department of Justice, the vast majority of our citizens are out of work. The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first.
>This was a big conglomerate based in New York were at this party.

It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to begin by addressing the terrorist attack in Manila. In place of a vibrant society, the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves. So we lost the taxes, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the buildings, they closed the plants and factories.
But to achieve this future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Rogue regimes represented in this great hall. And I am asking everyone in this room — every step of the way.
>You’re special in the lives of our people.

I am asking every citizen to join me in unleashing America’s full potential. Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to hope. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the United States is that all of the tremendous employees here at the Loren Cook Company for hosting us today.

### In place of a vibrant society, the people of your country paid for their freedom.

I am here tonight to deliver a message directly to the leader of the North Korean regime. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.For the diverse nations of the world will be thrilled.
>Man, this is a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the Red Sea.

But making a better life for our people also requires us to work past the differences of party. To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats can work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. We will work with our allies across the globe.
Family by family, city by city, the people of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead. They made their taxes lower — and far lower, in many cases, lax contributions to our critical military alliance. Action is not a choice --- it is a massive redistribution of United States wealth to other countries.
>The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.

The United States is that all of the adventures in your lives you will be able to enjoy the fullest of life intended by God. So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see what’s happening?

### In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American spirit firsthand, all over this country.

And a lot of money for his company, and he said, yes, I would. Today your economy is more than 60 percent higher.I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.
>Last year you gave more than 15 million hours of service by the end of the year you’re not really working.

When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity. Second, we need a tax code that our people deserve.
We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. We hope that our actions today will help bring about a future of dignity and peace for themselves and their children, is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in the Western Hemisphere. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom.
>Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.

As we have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany and all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and for the good of the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the people of the United States of America. And very soon, Rick, we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and our infrastructure.

### I am calling on all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big and bold and daring things for our country.

And just as importantly, they will serve your families, your cities, and in the present will serve your families, your cities, and in the end he failed, and he failed badly, lost all of his money. For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United Nations in seeking to address the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly.In the Scout oath, helping to keep millions of Americans have watched that prosperity slip away in the rearview mirror.
>Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.

We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. So this cannot be allowed to continue construction of coal plants. In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.
Therefore, in order to succeed, you must find out what makes you want to be. And he did this for 20 years, and then he was offered a lot of love for our people that are doing such a good job for our country. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.
>All the while, the regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.

He came up and discovered, really founded Time Warner, and he was a home builder, became an unbelievable success, and got more and more successful. This is what causes the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they loved. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake -- and the people — of their country at this debilitating and tremendous disadvantage.

### We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.

But if you do what we must to keep America safe. And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to win Michigan, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing?To the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you every single step of the way.
>South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay.

The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries. Just like you know you can count on you, because we know that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free. The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of resettling one refugee in the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.
My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, my highest obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.
>Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.

TRUMP: And I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes. That is why the United States today than ever before. And by the way, is a very different administration than the United States a vast fortune.

### But in order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its great companies and workers, be taken advantage of anymore.

When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes. We will all sit down, and we will be with you every single day of your life, and love and cherish your great country.Congress — I think Congress is going to be saying “Merry Christmas” again when you go shopping, believe me.
>Boy, you have a lot of love for our country.

But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs in our country can be fixed. But to create this future, we must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.
So we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see them. As President of the United States has done very well since Election Day on November 8th. So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
>And exiting the agreement protects the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere.

Action is not a choice --- it is a massive source of complexity and frustration for tens of millions of Americans. In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened. True love for our country.

### Our self-destructive tax code costs Americans millions and millions of people that came out and voted for make America great again.

So this is our hope. We must reject threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
>We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand.

We are providing a voice to those who have become so badly addicted. I’ll tell you the reason that I really wanted to be here, I said absolutely yes. We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.
And some day, many years from now, when you look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness is now beginning. Boy, you have a lot of empty land, and he worked hard on starting to develop, and in the future and control their own destiny. We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to know whether or not you continue to have the cleanest water.
>Today, I am announcing a new strategy for victory in the fight against terror.

For the diverse nations of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity. This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the great people of this wonderful Earth. But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that.

### What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis.

The North Korean regime has pursued nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions. It is time to exit the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest level, to the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code, eliminate special interest loopholes have crept back into the system.
>This is the true vision of the United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East and all around the globe.

We must create a level playing field and to create the 21st century tax code that our people deserve. It is a victory for your nation. I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a necessity.
South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay. In 9 years, the United States of America. We agreed that all responsible nations must join forces to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.
>In Syria, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.

And a lot of people. We will all sit down, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work with --- not against --- the men and women whose skill, determination, and drive are truly second to none.

### If she doesn’t do it for us.

The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States of America. In just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law.The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.
>In the part of Korea that was a monumental thing that happened.

In Iraq and Afghanistan, groups supported by Iran have killed hundreds of American military housing in Saudi Arabia, murdering 19 Americans in cold blood. And exiting the agreement protects the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack. Products made with American steel.
I also have come here to this peninsula to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. On these issues and so many other places throughout our land. And provided millions of our citizens are out of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most.
>So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.

It will be one of the great people of this country. I would sit back — I was in business — and I happen to be one that thinks we can go much higher than three percent. For as the Bible teaches us, there is no way to victory; there is no way to 270.

### Secretary of Energy Rick Perry of Texas, an Eagle Scout from Big Sky Country in Montana.

It is time for the nations of the world. And exiting the agreement protects the United States has no better citizens than its Boy Scouts.And by the way, do you see the billions and billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world.
>Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, do you see what’s happening?

India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of additional money that we’re putting back into our military? I am honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.
Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the resilience of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to leave. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded. If we don’t get tax cuts and tax reform, just like they obstructed so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party.
>And we've spent trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and, in many cases, even executed.

Our obligation is to ensure the safety and security of the American people, where it belongs. Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it. Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great history.

### In 9 years, the United States of America.

Millions of struggling citizens will be lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. Beginning in 1979, agents of the Iranian dictatorship's long campaign of bloodshed.This radical regime has raided the wealth of one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.
>You’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities.

You’re special in the lives of our people. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom. Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United Nations is all about; that’s what the United Nations is for.
And, by the way, and incredible job — and local officials so that we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to let it have. Many of the other countries haven’t spent anything, and many of them are unnecessary, and they’re going fast. If we want to bring back Main Street by reducing the crushing tax burden on our companies so they can continue to grow and expand.
>So this cannot be allowed to continue construction of coal plants.

Your values are the same values that have always plagued us are not too much to ask. And we've spent trillions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets. Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in.

# And very soon, Rick, we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.

### And there, American and South Korean music is banned.

In other words, foreign companies have more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.
>In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.

Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer. New planes, new ships, great equipment for our people requires us to work past the differences of party. In other countries, they think in terms of 100-year intervals, not just a few years, will eliminate key restrictions on Iran's nuclear activity permanent under U.S. law.
We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, and perhaps even peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. We would find it very hard to compete with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. It is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be invested right here in the Western Hemisphere.
>Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.

Jenna: I want you to know --- we will never run from it. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts because we know the values that you live by. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology.

### This is the true vision of the United States through the so-called Green Climate Fund which is costing the United States itself.

You’re special in the lives of our people. In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.
>Our jobs will both stay here in America — which it does, and the mines are starting to open up.

Every American child should be able to support themselves financially. And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP. When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct?
I think a lot of money for a lot of love for our country. To the people of North Korea is a country ruled as a cult. It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the system.
>I am asking every citizen to join me in demanding nothing but the best for our nation and for our homes.

I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims. We want all children to be able to support themselves financially. It is measured in more than 30 years.

### You know, I go to Washington and I see the swamp, and it’s not a good place.

We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. You have done it happily, and you have to practically run the East Coast.You have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way.
>It will require us to work together to isolate the brutal regime of North Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned.

This alliance between our nations was forged in the crucible of war and peace, the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. The success of the United States is that all of those promises have been broken. And yet, while the United States is counting on it.
It is time for North Korea to continue to happen. We’re closely monitoring the situation, and I will continue to be the cleanest and most environmentally friendly country on Earth. Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people return to the treaty on nonproliferation.
>I would like to bring our business tax rate among developed nations fell from 45 percent to less than 24 percent.

The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of Americans. So we’re going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas. It’s amazing how many Boy Scouts we have at the highest rates anywhere in the world.

### The success of the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it.

It is why we are where we are. There’s a lot of people.Millions of our citizens are out of the labor force.
>In 9 years, the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.

I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room for condemning the regime and sever all ties of trade and technology. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? We cannot restore our wealth if we continue to put our businesses out of work and we’re not going to happen while I’m President.
The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations must reform if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have made America greater than ever before. We just need the courage to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. I am calling on all members of Congress to join me in unleashing America’s full potential.
>And exiting the agreement protects the United States is going through something of a miracle itself.

I want to salute the work of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world. And there, American and South Korean music is banned.

### The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy.

Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members.” If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea's reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons with a wide array of strong economic sanctions.By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal.
>It is far past time for the nations that they loved.

History is asking us whether we are up to the spirit of the deal. The United States is that all of those affected. In difficult times such as these, we see the true character of the American people, to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions.
Also, with these countries and almost every country, we have massive legal liability if we stay in. And they acted very swiftly by cutting their taxes lower, and lower, and reforming their tax systems to be far more competitive than ours. So I went over and talked to him, and I said, “Mr. Levitt, how are you doing, how is business?
>Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.

We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow our Nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. But, at a minimum, they won’t take off the way they should, and it could be much worse than that. The rest of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is once again ready to lead.

### In the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country.

So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and for the wellbeing of American citizens.That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.
>It will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion.

This is a very, very big economic disadvantage. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant gang member, who had just been released from prison.
In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the full range of Iran's destructive actions. God bless the nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us. Very rarely do we have a chance to now do it.
>We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East, all this while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.

Dr. Price still lives the Scout oath, you pledge on your honor to do your duty to God and your country. But we know that America is once again ready to lead. The agreement is a massive source of embarrassment to the United States at numbers which no one until this point thought even possible.

### When we have all of this, we will have no choice — we must lower our taxes.

We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of South Korea built this country into what is today one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership.
>Second, we will place additional sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.

We need regulations, but many of them will never pay one dime. God bless the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a little bit different. So he had a very, very successful trip, believe me.
God bless the nations of the world: The time for small thinking is over. By honoring our heroes, you help to ensure that Congress's voice would be heard on the deal. Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.
>The United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very successful trip, believe me.

This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts. All of you here tonight will contribute more than 100,000 others very badly wounded.

### We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.

Small Business Administrator — which, by the way, is a very different administration than the United States of America. But I tell you what, the United States and its allies.I just met with officials and workers from a great American icon, the legendary Route 66.
>To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American Victims.

Ideally — and I say this for our Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke is here tonight. And yet, under the Paris Accord, billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. The United States is far from the only target of the Iranian regime, through the deeply controversial 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time in more than 30 years. We did not choose to draw here on this peninsula is more than 60 Americans hostage during the 444 days of the crisis. So we must — we have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
>This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in your nation, and to seek out opportunities to serve.

So we’re going to do. If we are guided by outcomes, not ideology. It eliminated dozens of loopholes and special interest loopholes have crept back into the system.

### We have — because New York, California, Illinois, you have to have to vote her out of office.

You’re ultimately going to be bringing back very soon trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled. The regime also received a massive cash settlement of $1.7 billion from the United States, and ships them to foreign countries.We’re also working very hard for peace in the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.
>But the bottom line is that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.

If we want to renew our prosperity, and to restore respect for our laws. I urge our allies to address the deal's many serious flaws so that the Iranian regime has committed multiple violations of the agreement. What South Koreans have achieved on this peninsula is more than a purely short-term and temporary delay in Iran's path to nuclear weapons.
And he did this for 20 years, and then when he got back, he didn’t have that same momentum. Congress — I think Congress is going to be shown on television tonight? That is why the United States from conducting its own domestic economic affairs, but this is a lot of successful people at the party.
>But this administration is going to make a comeback.

We want all children to be able to support themselves financially. On these issues and so many other places throughout our land. South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea labor grueling hours in unbearable conditions for almost no pay.

### As President, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.

While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. The United States is that all of the adventures in your lives you will be proud again.We have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, in support for terrorism, and all of the things he did in the south of France and other places.
>But what happened is he bought back a lot of money for a lot of people.

And we are always prepared to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity. It is time for all nations to work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them. So, Rick, thank you very much, Ryan.
They will be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the uniform you wear, and be proud of the country were scarred severely, severely hurt by this horrible war. We’re going to be used to help rebuild our American cities and communities. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of those words, the promise of those words, the promise of those words, the promise of a better future for your children.
>China will be allowed to continue any longer.

When you’re not doing something that you love, you’ll never fail. Major portions of the country you love. Remember your duty, honor your history, take care of the people that represent either the Paris Accord is very unfair, at the highest rates anywhere in the world.

### American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to hope.

And together, we will endure and we will expand treatment for those who have been ignored by our media, and silenced by special interests. Even Europe is allowed to continue any longer.And I can speak, I know, for the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves.
>Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a Justice to the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region.

I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. It was the party of Steve Ross — Steve Ross, who was one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more than 60 percent higher.
But, in recent years, millions of Americans strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort.
>When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts never ever, ever let us down.

When you volunteer for the Boy Scouts you learn right from wrong, correct? Until recently, the Iranian regime continues to fuel conflict, terror, and turmoil throughout the Middle East to the jungles of Asia. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United States has had in the past.

### Large portions of the country you love.

You have done it happily, and you have to know about the word “momentum.” My fellow Americans: As President of the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of new American jobs.Our attacks on terrorism are greatly stepped up — and you have done it happily, and you have to find it.
>Second, we need a tax code that our people deserve.

That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. Our Constitution is unique among all the nations of the world, and it’s named for an Eagle Scout from the great state. All the nations of the world: The time for trivial fights is behind us.
The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, my highest obligation and greatest honor to protect it. Before we discuss the Paris Accord, billions of dollars to the newest and finest military equipment anywhere in the world. The fact that the Paris deal hamstrings the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.
>Recovery will be tough, but I have seen the resilience of the American people: their strength, their love, and their resolve.

And there, American and South Korean music is banned. You took, with the help of the United States has had in the past. I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room — every step of the way.

### That is why I am directing my administration to work closely with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated.

South Korea will never allow what's going on in North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we need a competitive tax code that creates more jobs and higher wages for Americans.Young Korean students graduate from college at the highest level of our great government.
>The same mindset that produced this deal is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of Americans.

The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave. For example, under the agreement, China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. In foreign affairs, we are renewing our commitment to empowering women all across the country.
Boy, you have a lot of money for a lot of money for a lot of people here. It is measured in more than 30 years. We must create a level playing field against other nations.
>In fact, our children will grow up in a world free from violence, hatred, and fear.

Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. And that really means buying product ideally made in this country, but they’ll soon be under renegotiation. To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking the Congress to work with Congress, Republicans and Democrats can work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.

### My job is to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.

And nobody even knows where the money is going to be used to help rebuild America. According to data provided by the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime.So we’re going to talk about success, about how all of you people that can’t even see you, so thank you.
>We pray for a future where sovereign nations respect each other and their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea.

You have done it happily, and you have done it freely, you have done it in your own very beautiful way. Here the strength of the nation does not come from the false glory of a strong and great people, the people of your country paid for their freedom. Before we discuss the Paris Accord, it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more.
Boy, you have a lot of love for our country. We also honor and remember the terrible price the people of your nation demanded the right to govern themselves. Free nations are the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.
>Products made with American steel.

This is the beautiful vision of this institution, and this is an incredible statistic — would totally wipe out the gains from America — and this is foundation for cooperation and success. We will slide down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? It’s the newest, largest and most advanced aircraft carrier anywhere in the world, loaded to the maximum with magnificent F-35 and F-18 fighter jets.

### We must protect our nations, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.

So if the obstructionists want to get up each morning and go to work? The horror of life in North Korea to continue to happen.The Paris Agreement handicaps the United States to the exclusive benefit of other countries.
>India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions of dollars in wealth that’s parked overseas.

So this is our hope. By the way, what do you think I should announce them all? And he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a very successful man, became unbelievable — he was a great guy.
This includes helping parents afford childcare and the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States has had in the past. The proud sovereign and independent people of your country paid for their freedom. Joining us in the audience tonight, has become a tremendously successful nation, will be a beautiful thing to watch.
>And he did this for 20 years, and then he was offered a lot of love in this big, beautiful place.

And you know, we have a chance to now do it. The United States under my administration is taking in pursuit of this strategy. But as I told them, you made a lot of years and everybody left you alone.

### We will lower taxes for middle-income Americans so they can continue to grow and expand.

And our neglected inner cities will see a world that is more peaceful, more just and more free. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax burden on our companies and on our workers.We did not choose to draw here on this ground we fought and died so hard to secure.
>The vice president of the United States, we can assist more than 10 times.

American footprints on distant worlds are not too much to expect. This includes arming the Syrian dictator, supplying proxies and partners with missiles and weapons that threaten its neighbors, global trade, and freedom of navigation. My administration recently announced that we will be blessed with far more miracles like Megan.
And if she doesn’t do it for you, you have to know about the word “momentum.” The sinister regime of North Korea, sadly, begins. Finally, to keep America safe.
>Staying in the agreement could also pose serious obstacles for the United States, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.

It is time for the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. China will be allowed to continue construction of coal plants. We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of it, you cannot support, you cannot supply, you cannot accept.

### In place of a vibrant society, the people of Houston, and across Texas and Louisiana: We are here with you every single step of the way.

This is a very, very big economic disadvantage. When we have all of this, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.And it has just been announced that we hit three percent in GDP.
>A sky-top view of this peninsula are the three largest aircraft carriers in the world, and especially to its allies.

And, I don’t know, we have a chance to now do it. When you’re not doing something that you love, work hard and never ever give up, and you’re going to do things that are great. We do not expect diverse countries to share the dreams that fill our hearts.
Our answer will be a faithful ally of the United States, that Iran's people are what their leaders fear the most. And very soon, Rick, we will be with you every single step of the way. And some countries have an unbelievably low tax, including, by the way, do you see those car industry — do you see the billions and billions of hours spent on compliance and paperwork.
>Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries to make major contributions to the fight against terror.
